                        <p>The First Crane of Mount Hua, Baek Mu-Seong.<br><br>In the land of Shaanxi, no, in the entire Murim, there was no one who did not know his name.<br><br>Cherished as the True Heavenly Sword's prime disciple, Baek Mu-Seong had been hailed since youth as the destined future leader of the Mount Hua Sect.<br><br>Whispers swirled among the murmurs, tales of the Sword Saint's youngest pupil, yet none contested Baek Mu-Seong's inevitable ascent to sect leadership.<br><br>"It's said that the martial prowess of the Divine Dragon of Mount Hua has already surpassed the elders of the Nine Great Sects. Truly a genius that appears once in a hundred years."<br><br>"Still, the next leader has to be the First Crane of Mount Hua. Baek Mu-Seong is different. He is born with all the qualities required of a leader."<br><br>"That's right. Whether it's his martial arts or his character, who else but him could be the leader?"<br><br>Those at Xi'an Tower's ground level, savoring their drinks, remained oblivious.<br><br>Oblivious to Baek Mu-Seong's quiet passage behind them.<br><br>"I have long heard of the reputation of Master Baek. It's an honor to meet you."<br><br>"Master? You flatter me too much."<br><br>"Not at all. It's only right to call a Master what he is. What's excessive about that?"<br><br>Baek Mu-Seong offered a modest smile in response to the guard's fervent admiration.<br><br>Being the center of attention was familiar territory.<br><br>With the reclusive Sword Saint Mae Jong-Hak's rise, Mount Hua Sect's influence had grown, as had Baek Mu-Seong's responsibilities.<br><br>'A leader, they call me.'<br><br>For Baek Mu-Seong, still in his early thirties, the title felt both distant and burdensome.<br><br>With a mental shrug, he paused as the guard stopped.<br><br>"Here we are."<br><br>"This place is…"<br><br>"The only separate residence in Xi'an Tower, which we proudly claim to be the best in Shaanxi."<br><br>Surveying the opulent interior, complete with a jade-and-stone garden, Baek Mu-Seong expressed his unease.<br><br>"I'm sorry, but I don't have enough money to use a separate residence. Could you instead provide me with a quiet room?"<br><br>"Ha ha, as modest as I've heard."<br><br>The guard's laughter echoed as he spoke.<br><br>"Don't worry. The owner of the tower has repeatedly said that if a guest from the Mount Hua Sect visits, we should not charge them anything and treat them with the utmost care."<br><br>"The owner of the tower, you say?"<br><br>"Yes, last autumn there was a certain issue with the Southern Edge Sect, but it was smoothly resolved with the help of the Mount Hua Sect. The other two disciples of the Plum Blossoms Three played a major role."<br><br>"Ah, I see. That happened while I was in isolated training, so I wasn't aware."<br><br>"I've only heard about it in stories, too. I've only been working here for about a month, ha ha."<br><br>Baek Mu-Seong nodded, his understanding deepening.<br><br>His own past year had been anything but idle.<br><br>Encountering Cheong Pung and Jin Tae-Kyung, both era-defining geniuses, had profoundly shocked and inspired Baek Mu-Seong, propelling him into a year of solitary training.<br><br>'It was a meaningful time.'<br><br>The enlightenment he gained in seclusion had not only enhanced Baek Mu-Seong's strength but also deepened his wisdom.<br><br>Yet, more had changed; the Mount Hua Sect's status had soared remarkably in this period.<br><br>Even the government, replete with Southern Edge's secular disciples, now prioritized Mount Hua in crises.<br><br>'If the letter sent by my Master is true, it's no wonder.'<br><br>Just five days prior, Baek Mu-Seong received a startling letter from his Master, the True Heavenly Sword.<br><br>It detailed the bloodbath at Shaolin, the Dharma King's demise, and the potential appointment of Sword Saint Mae Jong-Hak as the new Murim Alliance leader.<br><br>"Chaos reigns everywhere. My friends even queried if their martially gifted child could join Mount Hua Sect as a secular disciple."<br><br>Baek Mu-Seong's smile held a trace of bitterness, perceiving the guard's hopeful subtext.<br><br>The guard, likely over forty, yearned for his child to join Mount Hua Sect, a common parental aspiration.<br><br>Feigning obliviousness, Baek Mu-Seong responded,<br><br>"Well, if fate allows it, it may be possible. But is there really a need to learn martial arts? At that age, growing up healthy is good enough."<br><br>"…Is that so?"<br><br>The guard's face fell, disappointment evident, as Baek Mu-Seong thought,<br><br>'If only you knew of the impending storm, your expression would differ.'<br><br>Whispers of the Shaolin bloodshed were already circulating.<br><br>Yet, the existence of Dark Heaven remained a closely guarded secret, known to a select few, including Baek Mu-Seong, who sensed an approaching crisis.<br><br>A blood wind loomed over Murim, dark clouds gathering, foretelling a time when countless weapons would fall alongside their wielders.<br><br>Echoes of grieving parents and orphaned children would soon fill the air.<br><br>'We, Mount Hua, must prevent this. We must.'<br><br>Baek Mu-Seong's conviction mirrored what was needed throughout Murim.<br><br>His mood darkening, the guard looked puzzled.<br><br>"Where is the manager? Manager!"<br><br>"Young Master, the manager has stepped out for a moment. Please calm down and..."<br><br>"Calm down? After I've been treated like this, you expect me to calm down!"<br><br>"But, as I said, the separate residence is already full. I'll guide you to a special room, so please calm your anger."<br><br>"It's so noisy! I must use the separate residence today, move aside now!"<br><br>"Ah, Young Master!"<br><br>Bang! Crash!<br><br>The commotion and shouts escalated, drawing nearer. The guard's expression soured as he apologized,<br><br>"I apologize for showing an unpleasant scene. It seems my subordinates have failed to handle the situation properly."<br><br>"Don't mention it. I completely understand."<br><br>No matter how carefully guests are selected, Xi'an Tower was still a beautiful place. It's natural for insects to flock to a flower garden.<br><br>"Still, it's only noon and he seems quite drunk."<br><br>"It happens often. He appears to be from a noble family, but we'll handle it smoothly and send him back. You don't have to worry, Master Baek."<br><br>Baek Mu-Seong gave a wry chuckle, shaking his head.<br><br>"Ha ha, well, I think I should stay here."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"He doesn't seem like an ordinary noble's son."<br><br>"What do you mean by that…"<br><br>The guard's confusion was palpable, but he fell silent, alert to the growing chaos and an approaching aura.<br><br>'A Murim warrior!'<br><br>In the escalating tension, guards scrambled in the inner courtyard, their shouts piercing the air.<br><br>"Stop right there!"<br><br>"You cannot pass this point!"<br><br>Despite the high security, befitting a venue frequented by dignitaries, these seasoned warriors seemed ill-equipped to handle the drunken agitator.<br><br>"How dare these lowly thugs from the streets try to stop me..."<br><br>"Ha!"<br><br>Swoosh, thud!<br><br>The guards' brief cries and the sound of swift, potent strikes quickly quieted the surroundings.<br><br>The unsteady footsteps resumed, breaking the eerie calm.<br><br>'To take down six first-rate warriors instantly while in such a drunken state.'<br><br>He's undeniably a martial arts Master, perhaps even a Peak Master.<br><br>As the guard tensed, hand on his sword, Baek Mu-Seong subtly signaled him to refrain.<br><br>"It seems I should step in."<br><br>"Master Baek, that would be..."<br><br>"It's fine. We've met a few times before, so he'll probably back down out of respect for me."<br><br>"That means..."<br><br>"We have a connection that dates back generations. Ah, but..."<br><br>Baek Mu-Seong lightly scratched his cheek, adding,<br><br>"It's not exactly a friendly connection."<br><br>"…!"<br><br>The guard's mind raced, connecting dots.<br><br>The Southern Edge Sect, notorious in its own right, and the name associated with it was that of one infamous individual.<br><br>"Could it be?"<br><br>As a guard at Xi'an Tower for just over a month, he was well-versed in the tales of this notorious Southern Edge figure.<br><br>He was as famous for his fiery temper as for his heritage.<br><br>The guard's expression contorted as he was about to utter the name.<br><br>Crash!<br><br>The door of the exclusive residence, made of sturdy black wood, burst apart, scattering splinters everywhere.<br><br>Baek Mu-Seong greeted the young, irate man stumbling toward him with a smile.<br><br>"It's been a while. How have you been?"<br><br>Simultaneously,<br><br>"Why are you here?"<br><br>Hyuk So-Pyung, known as the Southern Edge Lone Dragon, grimaced fiercely, resembling a wrathful demon.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>"Wow! Wow!"<br><br>"Please stop yelling. Everyone is staring at us."<br><br>"My savior! Look, sweets!"<br><br>"Forget those damn sweets. Aren't you tired of them?"<br><br>"No!"<br><br>"Then just open your own store!"<br><br>"Can I go to Sichuan with the sweets vendor then?"<br><br>"No, are you crazy…"<br><br>"Over there, they're selling noodles! They say it's made with beef broth!"<br><br>Cheong Pung, you unpredictable kid. You're like a bouncing ball, never knowing where you might jump next…<br><br>I swiftly grabbed Cheong Pung by the collar as he made a beeline for a street vendor.<br><br>"Please, just be a normal person. Just for once!"<br><br>"Sweets, noodles…"<br><br>"Ah, just wait a bit, and I'll feed you till you burst!"<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>"How many times have I told you? So, please, just keep your mouth shut and follow me quietly, okay?"<br><br>Admittedly, I'd be spending Mount Hua Sect's funds, not my own, but that hardly mattered.<br><br>'I was supposed to just pass through here.'<br><br>Xi'an wasn't initially on my itinerary.<br><br>Yet, the True Heavenly Sword, leader of Mount Hua Sect, had suggested a detour through Xi'an. Considering it was Cheong Pung's hometown, it seemed a fitting choice.<br><br>After a week's march, devoid of decent meals or a bath, the prospect of a day's rest and good treatment was appealing.<br><br>'The First Crane of Mount Hua, Baek Mu-Seong, is waiting there.'<br><br>It had been over a year since our last meeting.<br><br>Before departing for Anhui with Jeok Cheon-Gang, Baek Mu-Seong had told me,<br><br>"Whenever you're in Shaanxi, let me know. I'll ensure you're well taken care of. Ha ha."<br><br>I had half-expected empty boasts, akin to a Busan native's grand claims, but it seemed Baek Mu-Seong meant his words.<br><br>And now, here we were, set to meet.<br><br>"Anyway, where is Xi'an Tower?"<br><br>I asked a passerby who instructed me to follow the main road. Yet, amidst the bustling crowd, it seemed a never-ending path.<br><br>Scanning the surroundings, a dirt-smudged finger pointed towards a distant building.<br><br>"That's Xi'an Tower."<br><br>"Where? Oh, really. How did you know?"<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang, destined to be the Beggar King, replied with a hint of pride.<br><br>"It's the best place to beg. The leftovers are like delicacies, and since high-status people come and go, there's a lot of charity. Any beggar worth their salt knows this place."<br><br>"…"<br><br>A beggar's haven, it appeared.<br><br>Shaking my head, I made my way to Xi'an Tower.<br><br>Approaching the grand entrance, large enough for a crowd to pass through, a guard, presumably of Xi'an Tower, bowed.<br><br>"I'm sorry. We're not open for business today."<br><br>"What? Is it a day off?"<br><br>"It's not that. There's been a bit of trouble during business hours."<br><br>"Ah."<br><br>This turn of events was unexpected.<br><br>Casting a glance to the side, I noticed Cheong Pung, teetering on the brink of tears.<br><br>Rubbing my head in thought, I addressed the guard.<br><br>"Is there any way we can go in? I had an appointment today. With Baek Mu-Seong. They said you would know the name."<br><br>"I repeat, currently it's... Wait, did you just say Master Baek Mu-Seong?"<br><br>"Yes. The First Crane of Mount Hua, Baek Mu-Seong."<br><br>In desperation, Cheong Pung cried out.<br><br>"Baek Sajil! Where are you, Baek Sajil! Can you hear my stomach growling?" \[Note: "sajil" here means "martial nephew".\]<br><br>The guard, initially hesitant, swiftly swung open the main gate.<br><br>"We will escort you to the separate residence immediately!"<br><br>What's this all about?<br><br>Why such a sudden change of response?<br><br>'Did Baek Mu-Seong stand us up?'<br><br>But my speculation was off the mark. Hastily escorted by the guard, now almost jogging, we reached a nearly demolished separate residence where Baek Mu-Seong stood, awaiting us with sword in hand.<br><br>Incredible, what a scene.<br><br>'It's really a full course.'<br><br>But I can't eat a martial artist.</p>
