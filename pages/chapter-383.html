                        <p>The jet that Wei Feng-Hu had prepared was significantly different from what had been expected.<br><br>'It's spacious. And lavish.'<br><br>Peering through the slightly ajar door, a glimpse of opulence was evident — a luxurious table and a seat befitting a chairman caught the eye.<br><br>Mr. Choi, positioned beside us, remarked that the jet we were on was valued at nearly a hundred billion won. \[Note: approximately 7.4 million USD.\]<br><br>「I didn't expect to see an aircraft used for state guests here.」<br><br>Wei Feng-Hu responded with a serene tone.<br><br>「It's to be expected. You gentlemen are esteemed state guests of our nation.」<br><br>"Ah."<br><br>「Thanks to you, we were able to save many soldiers and hunters. Everyone, including myself, will never forget today's help.」<br><br>"Ah, yes."<br><br>Silently, I harbored hopes that they would address the issues of air pollution and historical revisionism as well.<br><br>Hoping secretly that China was more conscientious than I knew, I boarded the aircraft.<br><br>The pilot waiting for us, or for Wei Feng-Hu, saluted sharply.<br><br>「Minister of National Defense, sir! You have arrived!」 \[Note: the literal translation of the first part of this sentence is "Comrade Minister of National Defense!".\]<br><br>「Is everything ready?」<br><br>「All escort aircraft, including this one, are prepared. We are only waiting for your order.」<br><br>Curious about the mention of "escort," my gaze drifted to the runway outside, where five sleek, curved fighter jets signaled to us with blinking lights.<br><br>'What's that?'<br><br>The scenario seemed like a scene from a war film. Were we on the verge of entering a conflict?<br><br>Wei Feng-Hu, noticing my astonishment, began to speak.<br><br>「Although it hasn't been precisely disclosed to the public... As you know, Sichuan is currently in a state of emergency. Given the frequent magic-induced communication disruptions and attacks by flying monsters, an escort is essential for safety.」<br><br>"Is that so?"<br><br>The situation seems more serious than I thought.<br><br>Our own encounter with wyverns en route to Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport was but a glimpse; if similar events were unfolding across Sichuan, the implications were far greater.<br><br>「I wish I were lying.」<br><br>Exhaustion seeped into Wei Feng-Hu's demeanor as he reclined into the plush seat, the weight of the crisis visibly aging him.<br><br>「It seems we must part ways here. Hope to see you again soon. Senior Colonel Shao Shen.」 \[Note: Senior Colonel in the Chinese military is three promotions away from becoming a General. This would be equivalent to the American Brigadier general.\]<br><br>Shao Shen, who was not boarding the aircraft with us, stood at attention and saluted.<br><br>「Yes, sir. I will join you as soon as I complete my mission, Minister of National Defense sir, and you, gentlemen.」<br><br>「Yes, my expectations are high.」<br><br>A pleased smile crossed Wei Feng-Hu's face as he observed the promising young hunter, likely impressed by the significant strides the hunter had achieved.<br><br>Mr. Choi opted for a formal bow in greeting, while I offered a casual wave.<br><br>"See you again. You fought really well today."<br><br>It was a simple statement.<br><br>Yet, Shao Shen's reaction was anything but simple; his eyes widened to an astonishing degree, and with a jolt akin to an electric shock, he vocally expressed his gratitude,<br><br>「Th-thank you! I will work as hard as a dog or horse to not disappoint Mr. Jin!」<br><br>"...No need to work that hard, really."<br><br>「I wish for your safety and well-being!」<br><br>"Safety and well-being? What's that supposed to..."<br><br>Snap!<br><br>「Gasp!」<br><br>"......"<br><br>Poor guy.<br><br>In his fervor to salute, he accidentally struck his eyebrow with the edge of his hand.<br><br>Observing Shao Shen, who now sported a pained expression while biting his lip, I couldn't help but ponder as the door closed and the business jet we were on began its ascent.<br><br>"That guy has a... unique character."<br><br>My remark, tinged with a hint of awkwardness, elicited a chuckle from Wei Feng-Hu.<br><br>「He was praised by his idol. Is it surprising that he acted this way?」<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>「There are many young hunters in our country who admire Mr. Jin. Shao Shen is no exception.」<br><br>What, am I a Korean Wave star now? \[Note: the Korean Wave refers to the global spread of South Korean culture, including K-pop, K-dramas, films, and other things, which started in the 1990s.\]<br><br>Moreover, for an individual as formidable as a four-star general, Wei Feng-Hu seems remarkably attuned to the sentiments of his subordinates.<br><br>Or perhaps Shao Shen simply holds a special place among them.<br><br>That brings to mind...<br><br>\- Mr. Choi, what exactly does it mean to be the Minister of National Defense of the Central Military Commission? I'm not very familiar with this structure.<br><br>Startled by my Sound Transmission, Mr. Choi responded with Message Magic. \[Note: I'm 99% certain that this is the first time that Mr. Choi has used this, at least with the MC. It appears that he is just as startled as I am. Also, this would mean that Mr. Choi is a Peak Master, or the equivalent in modern times, as the MC only gains the ability for Sound Transmission after becoming a Peak Master.\]<br><br>\- In terms of our country, it's equivalent to our Minister of National Defense. Of course, this is China, and Wei Feng-Hu is the right hand of the current President, so his power is much more significant.<br><br>\- Ah.<br><br>So, it seems we're in similar positions. I'm the Minister of Gukbap, after all. \[Note: gukbap is a Korean dish consisting of hot soup poured over cooked rice.\]<br><br>If I have just one serving of Sundae Soup, I can easily destroy three bowls of rice. \[Note: Sundae soup is a bone broth made from pork bones and includes various internal organs of the pig.\]<br><br>Similarly, Wei Feng-Hu could probably just as easily destroy three cities with a flick of his finger.<br><br>And now, this powerful figure from the People's Republic of China is leaning forward in his seat to speak to us.<br><br>「It seems we have a lot to discuss on the way, doesn't it?」<br><br>Mr. Choi and I exchanged serious nods before voicing our queries.<br><br>「Of course. First, we'd like to know exactly what's happening in Sichuan...」<br><br>"But, do you have any boiled eggs and cider? Fighting hard has made me hungry."<br><br>"......"<br><br>"......"<br><br>I guess there isn't any.<br><br>「There are.」<br><br>"......?"<br><br>"......?"<br><br>Nice. They have some.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>People's Republic of China.<br><br>As the official name of China implies, this majestic land still embraces socialism as its foundational ideology.<br><br>About twenty years ago, the then-President solidified the foundation for dictatorship through his lifelong rule. Though he died during the Great Cataclysm, and a much more moderate regime took power, the essence remains the same.<br><br>\- What was the name of the dead president? Pingping? Paengpaeng? \[Note: I think the author is referencing Xi Jinping? This seems to line up with the timeline of the story. The first gate appeared in 2015, and Xi Jinping has been the president since 2013.\]<br><br>Mr. Choi, engaged in dialogue with Wei Feng-Hu, clenched his lips tightly, maintaining an expression as inscrutable as any seasoned gambler's.<br><br>\- ...Just so you know, speaking like that here could really land us in trouble.<br><br>\- That's why I'm using Sound Transmission, or rather, Message Magic.<br><br>\- I'm telling you to be careful. There are A-rank mages and above who can intercept Message Magic.<br><br>\- Anyway, was it Pingping, or Paengpaeng? I can't sleep without knowing.<br><br>\- ...Pingping.<br><br>Why bother warning me if you're going to answer anyway?<br><br>With my curiosity satiated, I refocused on the ongoing discussion with Wei Feng-Hu.<br><br>「It was something no one expected.」<br><br>Sichuan, a province of immense size, is home to tens of millions.<br><br>The origin of our current predicament lied within one of the over twenty administrative districts in Sichuan, the Gaoping district of Nanchong.<br><br>「As you know, our country has more than ten times the number of Gates compared to other countries. Therefore, we suffered incredible losses during the Great Cataclysm. As such, we have been monitoring these Gates meticulously.」<br><br>Yet, the force of humanity stands powerless against the whims of nature, with the monster wave presenting a catastrophe surpassing any natural disaster.<br><br>「We received the report that the magical power levels in Gaoping District surged exactly 13 minutes after the first sign of a breach. And by the time Lei Fei, the head of the Public Security Force stationed in Sichuan, led his hunters to the scene... it was already too late.」<br><br>"Lei Fei?"<br><br>It was an unfamiliar name. Yet, why does it somehow evoke a memory?<br><br>'The video that Mr. Choi showed at the guild house before we left.'<br><br>The memory is vivid: a city engulfed in chaos, displayed through a hologram, and a man cleaving through the monstrous horde, leading the hunters.<br><br>His weapon shimmered with an intense, captivating aura.<br><br>"I think I've seen him before. Could it be the one in the video you sent...?"<br><br>「Yes.」<br><br>Wei Feng-Hu paused momentarily, then, with a soft exhale, proceeded.<br><br>「He was one of our country's S-rank hunters. Of course, you gentlemen might not know.」<br><br>How is it that we hadn't heard of him?<br><br>S-rank hunters are scarce, their global count barely reaching twenty, and wielded immense power.<br><br>Their renown and prestige eclipse that of the Transcendent Masters in Murim.<br><br>Platforms such as the internet, news outlets, and social media serve as their stage, with their every move shadowed by microphones and cameras.<br><br>While martial artists might be regarded with a blend of caution and intrigue by ordinary people, hunters stand as figures of sheer admiration in the eyes of the modern populace.<br><br>'But to think we didn't know such an S-rank hunter?'<br><br>The implication in Wei Feng-Hu's words was unmistakable.<br><br>Mr. Choi and I locked eyes, a mutual realization dawning upon us.<br><br>'An S-rank hunter not revealed to the public.'<br><br>To put it precisely, an S-rank hunter whose existence the Chinese government deliberately conceals.<br><br>'I've heard rumors about this, but could it really be true?'<br><br>An S-rank hunter symbolizes a nation's might.<br><br>Yet, while the feeble may strive for visibility to avert underestimation, the truly powerful opt for obscurity, concealing their might.<br><br>It becomes evident that China, already acknowledged for its two S-rank hunters, chose not to disclose its full arsenal.<br><br>This practice likely isn't exclusive to China; other leading nations probably share this sentiment.<br><br>'Even after the Great Cataclysm, such cautious diplomacy continues.'<br><br>This revelation is at once disheartening and also understandable. Diplomacy, politics — it's as though we've peered into a sliver of the veiled machinations of our world.<br><br>Mr. Choi was a much sharper person than me.<br><br>「It sound like he was 'one of your country's S-rank hunters' in the past tense.」 <br><br>Wei Feng-Hu's response was marked by a profound solemnity.<br><br>「…A week ago, when the first monster wave occurred, Lei Fei went missing. Along with the hunters under his command in the Public Security Force.」<br><br>「Is the disappearance confirmed? Perhaps…」 <br><br>「We couldn't confirm his death. After that video, the monster known as the Lich, no, the Arch Lich, used its magic to block all communication and surveillance.」 <br><br>Mr. Choi and I sighed simultaneously. Wei Feng-Hu, his voice tinged with vulnerability, inquired,<br><br>「Do you gentlemen think Lei Fei is dead?」<br><br>"Um." <br><br>"Well…" <br><br>Given the harrowing chaos he vanished into a week ago, his survival seems beyond improbable.<br><br>Mr. Choi's meaningful look prompted me to add, with caution,<br><br>"Well, you know, it's uncertain what might happen to a person, but…" <br><br>「Other experts claim he's definitely dead, but they are useless charlatans.」<br><br>Really? They seem like real experts to me. <br><br>Anyone confidently asserting his survival under those circumstances should be immediately dismissed. It's evidently impossible. <br><br>「However, my thoughts differ. Lei Fei, that child, must be alive.」 <br><br>"I hope so too, but realistically speaking…" <br><br>「He's my only nephew. My sister, who was frail from childhood, didn't survive childbirth, and I've raised that little life as my own child ever since.」<br><br>"Excuse me?" <br><br>Nephew? Raised as his own child? What's the backstory here?<br><br>Tears welled in Wei Feng-Hu's eyes as he faced me, rendered speechless.<br><br>「What were you about to say? Realistically speaking...?」<br><br>Damn, this is a monumental crisis. <br><br>Suddenly at a loss for words, I managed to squeeze out words. <br><br>"Well, realistically speaking. I meant to say there's not zero chance he's alive." <br><br>「Is that so? Is that true?」 <br><br>"Yes, but the probability is very slim…" <br><br>「Thank you, Mr. Jin!」<br><br>"No, General. Commander. Minister. Just hold on and let me finish…" <br><br>Snatch!<br><br>Wei Feng-Hu's attention was elsewhere, his grip tightening around my hand as his eyes welled with tears.<br><br>「May I ask you for a favor?」<br><br>Deep down, I hoped he wouldn't voice that particular request.<br><br>Yet, against my silent pleas, he continued to ask.<br><br>「If you happen to meet that child later, could you bring him to me?」<br><br>"......"<br><br>「I earnestly ask this of you.」<br><br>In the background, beyond his earnest appeal, I noticed Mr. Choi's disapproving head shake.<br><br>What if I had given a firm answer from the start? I regretted it, but it was already too late.<br><br>There was but one response left for me to offer.<br><br>"I will. But..."<br><br>「Mr. Jin.」<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>「There's no need to say more. I am already prepared for the worst.」<br><br>"......!"<br><br>As he dabbed at his eyes with the cuff of his sleeve, the familial concern momentarily faded, revealing once again the Minister of the Central Military Commission.<br><br>「This is enough. Since no one else stepped forward, and you, Mr. Jin, have promised, I am reassured.」<br><br>"I can't guarantee it either."<br><br>「What I needed was not someone's grand promises. It was merely a sliver of hope.」<br><br>As Wei Feng-Hu muttered these words softly, the aircraft started to descend, giving a sense of floating.<br><br>The view outside revealed a tapestry of darkness interspersed with the rugged mountain terrain, flickering lights, and the occasional military convoy.<br><br>「It seems we have arrived.」<br><br>My gaze, drawn to the window as though lured by an unseen force, prompted a query.<br><br>"Where are we?"<br><br>「The temporary operational headquarters.」<br><br>"No, that's not what I asked."<br><br>「Hm?」<br><br>"The mountain. That mountain somehow feels familiar to me."<br><br>「Impossible. Mr. Jin, you haven't entered our country before... Ah, perhaps you've seen it in a photo?」<br><br>"A photo?"<br><br>「It's entirely possible, as it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.」<br><br>Wei Feng-Hu continued with a light smile.<br><br>「Welcome to the temporary operational headquarters, Qingcheng Mountain.」</p>
