                        <p>Click! Click!<br><br>The camera flashes were dazzling. While he was starting to get used to publicity, Tae-Kyung couldn't help feeling that he'd bitten off more than he could chew.<br><br>"Jin Tae-Kyung! Have you cleared the gate?"<br><br>"If not, why have you come out so soon?"<br><br>"What happened in the gate, Mr. Jin Tae-Kyung?"<br><br>The reporters unleashed a barrage of questions; if not for the gate security guards, he might have choked on one of the microphones thrust in his face.<br><br>Instead of answering, Tae-Kyung monitored the group passing through the gate.<br><br>Meanwhile, as the press delegation took in the scene, their initial enthusiasm seemed to fade.<br><br>"Why is he so bloody?"<br><br>"There are several people missing. I can only see Star Guild members..."<br><br>"Why are they tied up? What's going on?"<br><br>"Won Myung-Hoon? I can't see Won Myung-Hoon!"<br><br>Tae-Kyung could imagine what it must look like. He was drenched in blood and Butler Kim was leading an imprisoned raid team. Licking his dry lips, Tae-Kyung shook his head at Kim, who seemed about to step forward to speak. The old man paused.<br><br>[Their reaction is unsurprising. This was my choice, so I'll fix it.]<br><br>"Jin Tae-Kyung, what happened?"<br><br>Continuous camera flashes, whirring of video drones, a tangible buzz of excitement from the watching reporters.<br><br>Squinting at the sea of faces and shining lenses and waving mics, Tae-Kyung settled on a young man at the front. "Where are you from?"<br><br>Blinking, the young man adjusted his thick, horn-rimmed glasses. "Huh? Me?"<br><br>"Yeah, you."<br><br>The reporter blinked in panic and stammered a reply, "Uh, Hunter TV."<br><br>"Ah, great." Hunter TV was a highly-successful cable channel focused on hunter-related issues. This seemed to be a good place to share his story. "I'll take your questions."<br><br>"Pardon?"<br><br>"There are too many microphones, so I'll just focus on one."<br><br>"So... an exclusive?" Rookie or not, he was still a reporter. The bewildered look vanished; his eyes sparkled behind his glasses. "How about a live broadcast?"<br><br>"Live streaming?" After a brief pause, Tae-Kyung nodded. "OK, do it."<br><br>***<br><br>Of the countless channels registered on iTube, Hunter TV was one of the largest, with millions of subscribers in Korea alone. Within seconds of the decision, notifications rang on the phones and devices of Hunter Fans around the world.<br><br>[Hunter TV has started live streaming.]<br><br>[Exclusive live broadcast with Jin Tae-Kyung!]<br><br>In no time at all, 100,000 viewers had gathered, flooding the chat window with a sudden deluge of messages.<br><br>-What's with the sudden broadcast dudes?<br>-Dunno. Has it been a day since JTK entered the gate?<br>-It's an A-class gate, they can't be out<br>-Still buffering... >.<<br>-Mmm buttering...<br>-Oh, the screen's up! Here we go!<br>-All hail the Fuck King! Show respect!<br><br>The splash screen faded, replaced by the image of an enormous, crackling portal. The distinctive features of a young hunter turned to the camera.<br><br>-It's the Fuck King!<br>-Swear at me daddy!<br>-Spank my ass, too!<br>-Fuck, will you weirdos shut up!<br><br>Jin Tae-Kyung's popularity had skyrocketed. After saving countless lives at the B-class gate, he'd won widespread support for his casual appearance, then more for accidentally swearing at the Association President. However, the viewers soon noticed the strange atmosphere.<br><br>-Why's he doing this?<br>-He hurt? So much blood! D:<br>-Raiders missing or tied up? WTF is going on?<br>-Looks like shit went down...<br>-Hunter TV ask some questions FFS!<br><br>As if responding to the frantic chat, the reporter coughed and spoke. "Jin Tae-Kyung, thank you for speaking with us. Let me ask you directly. What happened inside the gate?"<br><br>"It's a long story, man. Can I summarise it?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>The image zoomed, filling the screen with Tae-Kyung's handsome face. Blood and dust caked his skin, but his eyes shone and, when he spoke, his voice was calm. "There was a Named monster. The gate mutated."<br><br>For a moment, the stream went quiet, as if muted. Then the chat exploded.<br><br>-???<br>-A Named? Here? o_O<br>-So they're all dead? I knew some were missing!<br>-Myung-Hoon, too? Noooo! I can't see him!<br>-This is crazy!!<br><br>This was a major incident. Clutching the microphone, Glasses stared in shock. Named monsters were infamous for their destructive power. After a gate break five years before, a single Named had destroyed several Central American towns. It was defeated after several days of battle, but at enormous cost: hundreds of hunters dead, along with thousands of civilians and billions of dollars' worth of damage. The world had watched the tragedy in horror.<br><br>-If there's a Named, it's a miracle anyone survived<br>-No no, wait<br>-That means there's a Named in the gate???<br>-You bin livin on Mars? Bitch, when da power's too high da gate breaks<br>-Yeah then monsters come out. Like in CA?<br>-Black Wyvern's Nest - anyone know where it is?<br>-Get the reporters out of there! (; _ ;)<br><br>The press corps at the gate, who had been alternately watching the interview and the chat stream, recoiled as though struck.<br><br>"Fuck, they're right! Grab the camera!"<br><br>"The gate's still active!"<br><br>No matter how valuable the story, it wasn't worth dying for. But even as the crowd began to scramble, a clear voice cut through the chaos.<br><br>"Ah, no, don't worry. We killed it already."<br><br>Reporters and news anchors in the studio. Viewers at home, or in the street, or sitting in cafes. Nobody could believe their ears.<br><br>-????<br>-I must have heard it wrong. Rewind?<br>-What did the King just say?<br>-He caught a Named monster?<br>-Who?<br>-The Fuck King!<br>-JTK! <3<br>-No. Way.<br>-Can't be right?<br>-Nah, no way<br><br>The camera had been shaking like an earthquake, but now it refocused. Glasses stuttered. "Say that again, please?"<br><br>"That's it, really."<br><br>"Then the Named...?"<br><br>"Yeah, a wyvern. We killed it."<br><br>At these incredible words, a hush again fell over the crowd. Rallying more quickly, one reporter called, "Your colleagues? Were there casualties?"<br><br>"We lost seven people." Tae-Kyung tilted his head in thought. "Ah, I should add Won Myung-Hoon. Eight casualties."<br><br>"Whoa, Mr. Won Myung-Hoon! Why?"<br><br>Tae-Kyung scratched his ear. "I caught him."<br><br>"P-pardon?"<br><br>"Oh, caught may be the wrong word. I killed him. Hmm, no, that sounds odd, too. Wait a minute..."<br><br>The shock from this new revelation reverberated through the assembled reporters and around the world. More than 100,000 viewers shared the same thought: [What the hell is he saying?]<br><br>In that moment, Tae-Kyung decided on the most appropriate way to clarify himself. "Perhaps it's best to say that I processed him."<br><br>"..."<br><br>At the end of a long silence, a single line appeared at the end of the frozen chat window.<br><br>-WTF does he mean by processing?<br><br>***<br><br>After that, everything happened in a rush. An official team was scrambled to the gate to meticulously investigate the case. The whole affair was incredibly high profile and subject to intense scrutiny from the National Government and the Hunter Association, not to mention the general public in Korea and beyond. The pressure was evident in every official statement.<br><br>However, in contrast to expectations, things became clear very quickly.<br><br>"Crazy. He really killed... that! Alone?"<br><br>After confirming that the titanic horror was dead, the investigators moved onto the next phase. The Star Guild raid team soon found themselves tied to cold iron chairs in the interrogation rooms at the Association.<br><br>"I don't know anything!"<br><br>"Look, Hunter. Don't make things complicated. We'll find out one way or another."<br><br>"I know my rights."<br><br>"Ha, you might as well talk. Once we bring in mind mages, you'll spill everything anyway."<br><br>"What the fuck did you just say? You can't say stuff like that. Everyone knows mind magic is illegal."<br><br>It was a fact of life. As B-rank hunters, the Star Guild members would never rot in a prison cell and, knowing this, were impossible to break. However, even as the investigators floundered, an unexpected saviour appeared.<br><br>Kim Jong-Hoon. Unable to manage his weakened spirit, the first team leader confessed everything.<br><br>This perfect testimony was supported by a USB and a note from an anonymous informant: [The Habsburgs, a family long-famed in Germany for their meticulous attention to detail, make rare yet practical items. This PSV-96K camera cannot be detected by magic and even works in unstable gates. Admire the resolution...]<br><br>Looking up from the note, the lead investigator frowned. "What the hell is he talking about?"<br><br>"They filmed the entire raid. The USB contains all the footage. Won Myung-Hoon had planned a betrayal."<br><br>"This recording is illegal, though. This from the Peace Guild?"<br><br>"I'd expect so."<br><br>"Huh. Turns out that they're doing what we want, then. We have physical evidence and they've been discreet, so it's mutually beneficial."<br><br>The door burst open. A smartly-dressed woman ran into the room and held up her phone. "Have you seen this?"<br><br>Standing proudly at the top of the real-time search were the words: [Won Myung-Hoon Raid Video Leaked!]<br><br>When the ugly side of the old star was revealed, the memories came flooding back; the Internet went wild.<br><br>-This is craaazy!<br>-My head hurts! It can't be real?<br>-Well killed, well killed<br>-This is murder. The killing of Won Myung-Hoon will go down in infamy!<br>└ Is that you Myung-Hoon?<br>└ How's the WiFi in Hell?<br>└ King Yeomra has turned on the hotspot<br>└ This is murder, not self-defence<br><br>Only two days had passed since the incident, but the storm showed no signs of abating. Whenever another secret about Myung-Hoon came to light, it stoked the online furore.<br><br>And after the initial anger, the netizens always came back to the same questions:<br><br>-But what is Jin Tae-Kyung doing?<br>-Is he sleeping?<br>-How will this get sorted out?</p>
