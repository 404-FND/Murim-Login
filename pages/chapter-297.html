                        <p>Sigh. Hoo.<br><br>Choi Min-Woo exhaled deeply, his breath mingling with the ambient Qi.<br><br>As he inhaled, he consciously absorbed the Qi saturating the air, simultaneously stirring the dormant cluster of Qi in his lower abdomen.<br><br>'Mana.'<br><br>It was the power bestowed upon the awakened, a formidable weapon against monsters.<br><br>Yet, his mentor, Jin Tae-Kyung, who had taught him the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique, referred to it differently.<br><br>'Qi.'<br><br>The more Choi Min-Woo observed Jin Tae-Kyung, the more enigmatic he seemed.<br><br>Undertaking and accomplishing feats others wouldn't dare dream of, his teachings were far from ordinary.<br><br>Dantian, Qi, Qi circulation, Jin Family's Cultivation Technique...<br><br>Each new revelation about him was astonishing, yet now, it was bewildering.<br><br>'To impart the Mana Cultivation Technique so casually...'<br><br>Choi Min-Woo understood the sheer power of the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique.<br><br>It was evident not only to hunters but to any perceptive individual.<br><br>If a hunter is a sword, then Jin Family's Cultivation Technique is a whetstone.<br><br>It could sharpen even the bluntest blade.<br><br>Given its effectiveness and rarity, its worth was immeasurable.<br><br>'Such generosity to divulge such a profound secret, the prowess to vanquish named monsters solo, the courage to confront Lee Jeong-Ryong and the Ares Guild... Is there anyone else like him?'<br><br>Each day, Choi Min-Woo's realization of Jin Tae-Kyung's extraordinariness deepened, as did his gratitude for being under Jin Tae-Kyung's tutelage.<br><br>'I must not fail to meet his expectations.'<br><br>This resolve fueled Choi Min-Woo to practice the Jin Family's Technique relentlessly, even in his sleep.<br><br>And now, the results were palpable.<br><br>Swoosh.<br><br>He was so engrossed in practicing the Qi circulation technique that time became irrelevant.<br><br>A powerful energy surged through his meridians, growing incrementally. A week ago, he hadn't even been aware of such energy.<br><br>Suddenly, a conversation he had with Jin Tae-Kyung that day flashed through Choi Min-Woo's mind.<br><br>'Hey, Team Leader.'<br><br>'Yes?'<br><br>'Did you ever consume something good when you were young? Like ginseng, or some round elixir?'<br><br>'Not at all. My meals have always been organic, but I've never eaten anything special.'<br><br>'I bet you've never even caught a common cold from childhood until now. Right?'<br><br>'That's correct. How did you know?'<br><br>'Your physical condition, it's... No, your body has always been remarkable.'<br><br>'Is that so? But any hunter would naturally have a good physique.'<br><br>'It's not merely because you're a hunter; it's fundamentally due to your extraordinary constitution. I suspect your grandfather may have played a role in this.'<br><br>'My grandfather...?'<br><br>'Yes. Does anything come to mind?'<br><br>'I'm not sure. I was too young to remember clearly. According to Butler Kim, he visited me occasionally... but that's it.'<br><br>'Hmm. Personally, I think that's the only answer.'<br><br>Choi Min-Woo's thoughts drifted to his grandfather. Had he last seen him before starting elementary school?<br><br>His memory of his grandfather's face was hazy, contrasting with the clarity of the photographs online. Their relationship, much like their physical proximity in those pictures, seemed distant.<br><br>'Could such immense energy within me be my grandfather's doing?'<br><br>This revelation about his grandfather set Choi Min-Woo's heart racing.<br><br>As if responding to his feelings, the energy coursing through him vibrated.<br><br>The tremendous amount of energy that Jin Tae-Kyung referred to as a 'Gapja' made one final, majestic revolution before settling calmly in his dantian, below his navel.<br><br>With a tingling sense of elation, Choi Min-Woo's eyes fluttered open.<br><br>"Hoo."<br><br>His prolonged breath held traces of the Qi cultivation technique.<br><br>Unbeknownst to Choi, he had achieved 4th level mastery of the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique in an astonishingly short period of a week.<br><br>For someone with Choi Min-Woo's immense Qi and remarkable constitution, which even Jin Tae-Kyung acknowledged, such rapid progress was possible.<br><br>'The others haven't reached this point yet.'<br><br>Surveying the room, Choi Min-Woo noted the three individuals deeply engrossed in their Qi cultivation.<br><br>Butler Kim, Song Song, and Mr. Rough Guy sat spaced apart, each absorbed in their practice.<br><br>Their learning of the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique was a closely guarded secret.<br><br>They were in Choi Min-Woo's private training room, heavily secured and isolated.<br><br>'I shouldn't disturb them.'<br><br>Remembering Jin Tae-Kyung's warnings about the perilous 'Qi Deviation,' Choi Min-Woo treaded lightly as he exited.<br><br>Outside, he reactivated his phone, which had been off for some time. Within moments, his jaw dropped in astonishment.<br><br>The screen lit up with a flurry of internet news updates, each more startling than the last.<br><br>\- Urgent News: Named Monster Reappears! South Korea Faces Crisis!<br><br>\- Unforeseen Complications at the A-rank Gate, \[Black Forest of the Necromancer\].<br><br>\- Jin Tae-Kyung's Heroic Act: Volunteers as Bait. Eyewitness Accounts Praise His Noble Sacrifice.<br><br>\- Hunter Association Mobilizes: Formulating Countermeasures, Assembling Rescue Teams.<br><br>\- Peace Guild in Disarray: Leadership Unreachable.<br><br>\- Public Outcry Grows Over Association's Delayed Response. Jin Tae-Kyung Alone for Over 20 Minutes.<br><br>\- Hope for a Miracle?<br><br>"Wait, what is this?"<br><br>What do they mean by sacrifice, and what about being alone?<br><br>Jin Tae-Kyung, who should be patrolling the gate with his guild members, is now being talked about as a sacrifice.<br><br>And now, a Named Monster had emerged!<br><br>Choi Min-Woo's initial shock quickly gave way to focused determination.<br><br>'This isn't the time for shock.'<br><br>He knew Jin Tae-Kyung's strength well enough.<br><br>Yet, if Jin Tae-Kyung had chosen to act as bait, allowing his guild to retreat, he must be facing an extraordinary peril.<br><br>'This is... really dangerous.'<br><br>His grip on the phone tightened just as the training room door swung open, revealing three figures.<br><br>"Ah, that feels refreshing."<br><br>"Mister, don't you think my skin looks better?"<br><br>"Ah, Young Master. You were already here..."<br><br>"Butler Kim!"<br><br>The urgency in Choi Min-Woo's voice instantly alerted the others to the gravity of the situation.<br><br>Butler Kim's voice remained calm.<br><br>"What's happened?"<br><br>"We need to go to Jin Tae-Kyung, right now!"<br><br>\*\*\*<br><br>The scene at the entrance of the A-rank Gate, \[Black Forest of the Necromancer\], was chaotic.<br><br>Hunters from the Association and various guilds had gathered for safety measures, alongside reporters daring enough to seek exclusive stories.<br><br>The air was thick with murmurs and whispers from the crowd.<br><br>"Is Jin Tae-Kyung dead?"<br><br>"It's grim. It's been silent for over an hour now."<br><br>"But didn't Jin Tae-Kyung already defeat a Named Monster once?"<br><br>"Ah, that Wyvern, right? Impressive indeed, but..."<br><br>While conversing with a junior reporter, the senior reporter flicked ash off his cigarette.<br><br>"Think about it, you're a Hunter section reporter. Didn't you hear the interview with the Peace Guild member who was with Jin Tae-Kyung? It wasn't just one Named Monster; there were hundreds more. It's a different case."<br><br>"Is it that serious?"<br><br>"Absolutely. We're only holding on because it's Jin Tae-Kyung out there. With anyone else, there wouldn’t even be a sliver of hope. This isn’t a rescue mission in the making. It’s more likely a recovery operation."<br><br>The junior reporter let out a subdued sigh.<br><br>"That's a tough situation."<br><br>"We're crazy to be here writing articles amidst this. Totally messed up."<br><br>"But we're allowed to report since it's somewhat secure, right?"<br><br>"See over there? More than a dozen A-rank hunters have come."<br><br>The senior reporter gestured towards a group of formidable-looking hunters.<br><br>Among them, the ones with crossed sword and shield emblems on their chests stood out.<br><br>"Ares Guild sent reinforcements too."<br><br>"They've just come in. They rarely heed government calls unless there's something in it for them... I wonder what drew them here."<br><br>"Did they come to rescue Jin Tae-Kyung?"<br><br>"Maybe. Or maybe they're after the Named Monster."<br><br>Named Monsters were treasures of immense value.<br><br>'One-Eyed Carus,' the recent one vanquished by Jin Tae-Kyung, was in its early stages of awakening but had already been worth billions.<br><br>"But... with this much force, can't they start the rescue operation now? We have enough power."<br><br>"Sure, we have enough. But they might be thinking differently."<br><br>"How so?"<br><br>"Never mind. Forget it."<br><br>The senior reporter abruptly ended the conversation.<br><br>A veteran of nearly two decades in journalism, he had a wide network and extensive experience. He had seen and heard more than most.<br><br>'Jin Tae-Kyung must have become a thorn in their side.'<br><br>Recently, he had stumbled upon intriguing information from a reliable source.<br><br>There was an unusual undercurrent between the Myeongdong and Peace Guilds.<br><br>It was a whisper in the wind, yet his journalistic instincts sensed an unfolding narrative.<br><br>'The appearance of the Ares Guild too.'<br><br>The presence of the Ares Guild was noteworthy but not unexpected, given the situation involving a Named Monster.<br><br>Yet, there was an air of unease, a feeling the reporter couldn't quite place.<br><br>His gaze shifted towards the group of leaders, his brow furrowing.<br><br>'Their palms will get worn out at this rate.'<br><br>The head of the Seoul branch of the Association, effectively in charge of the situation, was seen eagerly rubbing his hands while speaking to a man in his thirties.<br><br>'What was that guy's name? Seok Gosa… Seok Go-Jun?'<br><br>Recognized as the security team leader of the Ares Guild, Seok Go-Jun was practically Lee Jeong-Ryong's right-hand man.<br><br>The sight of the Seoul branch head pandering to him hinted at why the rescue team’s deployment was being delayed.<br><br>"These guys, always finding a way to have their fun."<br><br>The senior reporter muttered under his breath, extinguishing his half-smoked cigarette.<br><br>"It's the Peace Guild!"<br><br>"What? Where!"<br><br>"Hey, hey! Get the camera ready!"<br><br>Amidst the rising commotion and the media crew's shouts, all eyes turned in unison.<br><br>A group of four, three men and one woman, moved through the crowd with an air of purpose.<br><br>They reached the gate, only to be stopped by the Seoul branch hunters.<br><br>"Please step aside."<br><br>Choi Min-Woo's voice was calm but carried an unmistakable authority. The head of the Seoul branch approached hastily.<br><br>"It's not yet confirmed to be safe. We need more time to initiate the rescue operation..."<br><br>"Time? Are you still talking about time here?"<br><br>"Just a moment, just a brief moment is enough."<br><br>"Nearly an hour has already passed."<br><br>Choi Min-Woo's tone remained steady, but his eyes blazed with a fiery urgency, mirrored by his companions.<br><br>"We must begin the rescue now."<br><br>"Not now. Follow the policy."<br><br>"Whose policy? The Association's? Or..."<br><br>In an instant, Choi Min-Woo's gaze swept past the Association head, landing on Seok Go-Jun.<br><br>He bit his lip, frustration evident, then continued resolutely.<br><br>"Send the Association hunters away. If necessary, our Peace Guild alone will enter."<br><br>"Do you not realize that this goes against the regulations?"<br><br>The chairman of the Seoul branch replied in an authoritative tone, snapping his fingers. Hunters from the Seoul branch swiftly surrounded the Peace Guild members, their expressions a mix of disapproval and wariness.<br><br>"It won't take too long. Have patience and wait."<br><br>At these words, Choi Min-Woo's restraint shattered. His voice, fierce and full of desperation, echoed across the area.<br><br>"My friend is in there!"<br><br>Click, flash!<br><br>Cameras snapped furiously, capturing this intense moment, but Choi Min-Woo's impassioned plea continued unabated, his rage palpable.<br><br>"He could die! He must be saved!"<br><br>Images of Jin Tae-Kyung, battling alone against the Named Monster and its skeletal horde, ignited a seething volcano of fury within him.<br><br>"Move aside, you bastards!"<br><br>\*\*\*<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord spoke with a commanding voice.<br><br>\- In the name of the commander, arise. My faithful subordinates, the strong soldiers of the legion!<br><br>Suddenly, someone struck the Warlord's skull with a lightning-quick movement.<br><br>Thump!<br><br>"Damn it, really. Why are your spells so unnecessarily long? I told you to make it quick."<br><br>"..."<br><br>"Aren't you going to answer?"<br><br>\- ...Yes.<br><br>The Warlord's voice carried a tone of reluctant acquiescence.<br><br>\- Fine, fine. Skeletons, arise...<br><br>Whoosh!<br><br>A surge of magical energy erupted from the Warlord, blanketing The Black Forest.<br><br>The young man, witnessing the rapid emergence of skeletons from the earth, wore a bright, almost gleeful smile.<br><br>"Ah, looks like this year's harvest will be bountiful."</p>
