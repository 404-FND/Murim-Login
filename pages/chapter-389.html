                        <p>Swoosh!<br><br>As the Protective Qi covered blade swept through, geysers of hot blood erupted.<br><br>I trod upon the collapsing ogre as if it were mere straw and leapt into the air. The sunlight warming the nape of my neck felt comforting.<br><br>'Ah, it's the perfect weather for a fight.'<br><br>It was high noon, and the setting was a barren wasteland devoid of any trees.<br><br>My shadow stretched over the multitude of monsters below.<br><br>Even the swift plunge of my spear blade was captured in the elongating shadow.<br><br>'Heavenly Strike.'<br><br>Boom!<br><br>The fire dragon's claw tore through the earth.<br><br>It echoed as if the sky itself were tearing apart; the ground plunged, flinging dirt and stone in all directions.<br><br>A whirlwind of searing air erupted from the battlefield's heart, turning into a scythe sweeping through the monsters.<br><br>Boom!<br><br>Ding. Ding. Ding...<br><br>Amidst the dust-clouded view, green blood poured out along with system notifications of monster defeats.<br><br>With a light wave of my hand, the dust cloud dispersed, revealing monsters staring at me with dazed faces.<br><br>\- Kuak?<br><br>\- Grr?<br><br>Their gazes dripped with sheer confusion. I inhaled deeply and bellowed.<br><br>"Sweep them away!"<br><br>And the next moment.<br><br>「Waaaa!」<br><br>A thunderous charge erupted as a thousand hunters surged forth like a tidal wave, swamping the monster ranks.<br><br>Crack-crack-crack!<br><br>Gurgle!<br><br>As the monsters faltered helplessly, one thing became clear.<br><br>'We've won this battle.'<br><br>With the skirmish concluded, it was time to reap the rewards.<br><br>I approached the Twin-Headed Ogre, the apparent boss of this legion.<br><br>Come to me, my precious experience points. I must do this to minimize the damage to our troops, not because of some measly experience points.<br><br>「That one is the leader! Ranged units!」<br><br>"Hey, hey! Hands off! I'll handle this, so don't touch a single hair!"<br><br>By the heavens, I swear, there's no selfish intent here.<br><br>"......"<br><br>Hmm, upon reflection, it seems there might be no need to swear at all.<br><br>\- Wicked human. It's clear you aim to seize the spoils. You did not hide your greed even while slaughtering my legion!<br><br>"Just shut up and do your job, will you? Start the infighting among the undead now."<br><br>\- I was about to do just that. Grow, skeleton skele... Huh?<br><br>"What's wrong?"<br><br>\- Why isn't my power working? Could it be a glitch?<br><br>"......Where did you even pick up such a term?"<br><br>The increasingly modernized Skeleton Warlord spoke with a tone of defeat.<br><br>\- The closer we get to the epicenter, the stronger the Archlich's control seems to become. Hah, a commander without a legion. Truly lamentable. It's as good as being dead!<br><br>"......"<br><br>What does he think he is?<br><br>It's exhausting to remind him he's already dead. I sighed inwardly and rushed toward the leader.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>「It's a great victory! This time, too, it's a great victory!」<br><br>Shao Shen declared, his face flushed with excitement. Having witnessed such scenes repeatedly, Mr. Choi and I remained unphased.<br><br>'Well, it's quite exhilarating.'<br><br>It took just over two hours to obliterate an army of a thousand monsters.<br><br>And that with no fatalities on our side, a truly monumental feat. In such a moment, staying composed is almost expected.<br><br>「Our casualties are twenty-three seriously wounded and thirty lightly wounded. Oh, this is really...!」<br><br>Shao Shen, quivering like an eager puppy, gazed at me with eyes alight.<br><br>「How can you do this every time?」<br><br>"Um. Maybe it's because I'm strong."<br><br>At my response, Mr. Choi shot a look of mild disbelief.<br><br>"What's wrong?"<br><br>"No. Usually, at times like this, wouldn't you say it's good luck or something humble like that?"<br><br>"Usually, that's the case. But if it's not just luck, and it truly is my strength, what can I do? Right, Shen?"<br><br>Shao Shen nodded with enthusiasm.<br><br>「That's right! You are the best, Hyung!」<br><br>"Kid. You're a prime example of a flatterer."<br><br>"......"<br><br>As we engaged in light banter, Mr. Choi shook his head in mild disapproval.<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>"Nothing. It’s just typical Jin Tae-kyung, isn’t it?"<br><br>That sounded oddly insulting.<br><br>I shrugged my shoulders, turning towards Shao Shen to inquire,<br><br>"What about headquarters?"<br><br>「Ah, I had already contacted them before the battle started.」<br><br>Making contact implied he had dispatched a few hunters from our group ahead of time.<br><br>In the modern era, relying on runners might seem archaic, but with magical interference jamming communication and satellite surveillance, we have no alternative but to either move rapidly or utilize vehicles.<br><br>Fortunately, we're equipped with flares and other essential tools.<br><br>"It will take a while longer."<br><br>「They are following now, so it shouldn’t take too long.」<br><br>"It'll be tiring, but set up tents and let the kids rest. Even if the fight ended quickly, everyone's energy is drained after a battle."<br><br>「Shouldn’t we handle the large monsters ourselves? It seems like it would be difficult to move headquarters...」<br><br>"That's a fair point."<br><br>'Headquarters' refers to the mobile military units that accompany us.<br><br>Members of the Public Security Force, including myself, lead the charge against the monsters, while the military units that follow perform 'cleanup' — clearing the area and disposing of monster remains.<br><br>We use 'cleanup' quite literally, as the objective is not to collect spoils but to ensure proper disposal after battle.<br><br>The military forces I command on the western front are primarily engaged in dismembering fallen monsters to prevent them from rising as undead and transporting them to the rear areas.<br><br>「Uh, Hyung.」<br><br>"Yes, what is it?"<br><br>「I’ve been too embarrassed to mention this, but... it seems there’s been some talk among some of the high-ranking officers.」<br><br>"Talk? What kind of talk?"<br><br>Shao Shen looked around cautiously before whispering,<br><br>「Well, there seems to be some dissatisfaction with the roles they've been assigned...」<br><br>"......?"<br><br>What exactly does that mean?<br><br>It took a moment for me to grasp what Shao Shen was implying. After a tense silence, I responded in near disbelief.<br><br>"Do they want to stop cleaning up monster corpses and start earning merits or something?"<br><br>「......Yes.」<br><br>"Are these crazy bastards serious?"<br><br>The situation provoked an involuntary curse. While soldiers on other fronts fall daily, these complain about the monotony of corpse disposal.<br><br>Listening intently, Mr. Choi interjected smoothly.<br><br>"Don't be alarmed. It's just jjanggae being jjanggae."<br><br>I wonder if he would say this in front of a thousand Chinese people, but then, there’s a clear distinction between Chinese people and jjanggae people.<br><br>The face of Shao Shen, a representative good Chinese person, was suddenly red with shame.<br><br>「S-sorry. Not all the officers, just some individuals are harboring such complaints.」<br><br>"Some individuals, huh? I see. But there’s something I’m curious about..."<br><br>I narrowed my eyes and gestured toward something behind Shao Shen.<br><br>"Are those the bastards?"<br><br>In the distance, a column of a hundred armored vehicles and tanks kicked up a massive cloud of dust as they neared.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>Clank, clunk!<br><br>The vehicle jostled over the ravaged road. Peering through the military vehicle’s windows, I observed the scattered fields and disheveled homes.<br><br>After the cleanup, we were en route to a small town nearby.<br><br>「Ha ha, you've really worked hard, Mr. Jin!」<br><br>He had a belly that no tight belt could tame and a bald head that gleamed under the sun.<br><br>Had it not been for his military attire and the three stars on his shoulder, I might never have recognized this middle-aged man.<br><br>「As it happens, I got in touch with the higher-ups this morning. The UN Security Council and the entire world are in an uproar over Mr. Jin's victory report! I don't know what it all means, but in Korea, they are calling today the memorial day of the Jumo...」 \[Note: a "Jumo" translates literally to housewife or mother-in-law, but is used to describe a hostess who sells alcohol. In this case, "memorial day of the Jumo" would be a day where Jumos work themselves to death to bring alcohol to celebratory people.\]<br><br>Fed up with his ramblings, I couldn't contain myself and burst out,<br><br>"I don't care whether Jumo is dead or alive. May I ask you something?"<br><br>「Mr. Jin?」<br><br>General Liao, commanding officer of the 13th Group Army, which encompasses seven divisions and brigades of the Chengdu Military Region, looked at me with a hint of concern. \[Note: this is the man from chapter 386 who suggested using nuclear weapons on Sichuan.\]<br><br>「Why, what's going on? Was there some kind of incident?」<br><br>"I heard some strange stories today. I'm a bit sensitive right now."<br><br>「Who dares to upset Mr. Jin's mood! Ask away.」<br><br>"Ah, yes. What I wanted to ask is..."<br><br>I focused my gaze on General Liao's oily, shining face as I continued.<br><br>"I heard that some officers are quite unhappy because they want to earn merits... Did you know about that?"<br><br>「Cough.」<br><br>He was aware. Despite knowing, he had ignored it. It was so absurd that it actually calmed me down.<br><br>Nevertheless, he remains an ally and a high-ranking officer from another country. I addressed him with calm and respect.<br><br>"Could I see the faces of those bastard officers?"<br><br>「Cough!」<br><br>"Damn it, what kind of insane people want to earn merits in times like these? They're not even the ones going out to fight; they just stand behind the regular soldiers and wave their batons."<br><br>「Cough, cough!」<br><br>"What nonsense is this about being tired of cleaning up monster corpses? What, have they become so fond of them that they want to become corpses themselves? They really need to die to come to their senses. Fucking bastards."<br><br>「Cough, cough, cough!」<br><br>"If you identify those bastards, just come and tell me. I'll put them in the front lines dressed in gear. They'd make perfect human shields..."<br><br>Mid-rant, I halted abruptly. Sweat cascaded down General Liao's face like a waterfall.<br><br>「......」<br><br>"......"<br><br>This guy is one of those insane ones too.<br><br>Since he began discussing nuclear options in an underground bunker, it was clear he wasn't just any lunatic. He’s deeply irrational.<br><br>"......General, are you in your right mind?"<br><br>「Well, listen. We also need to have something to show for ourselves when it's all over...」<br><br>"No, we are progressing without casualties, opening paths at the front with hunters and cleaning up at the back with the army, rescuing civilians. We’re doing well, what more is there to show?"<br><br>Crack.<br><br>As I cracked my knuckles, General Liao frantically gestured.<br><br>「Ah, ahem! Let's not use informal language with each other. Considering my age and rank, I'm not someone to be treated like this by Mr. Jin.」<br><br>"Maybe I should just smash some sense into your head."<br><br>「W-what?」<br><br>"No, you must have heard wrong. Anyway, I understand, stop having foolish thoughts. From now on, we minimize casualties and proceed slowly while rescuing civilians. Do you understand?"<br><br>「......」<br><br>Why does he react like this?<br><br>The moment I noticed General Liao's eyes darting back and forth instead of giving a straight answer, a chill ran through me.<br><br>Could it be...<br><br>"Have you already issued the order?"<br><br>「Well, that's... I'm also involved in a military supply corruption case. It's a time when I need to achieve something on my own...」<br><br>"You damn bastard!"<br><br>Bang!<br><br>I kicked the bulletproof door right off its hinges. The driver, alarmed, immediately slammed on the brakes.<br><br>Screech!<br><br>"Huh?!"<br><br>Cowering and shaking, General Liao fumbled for words.<br><br>「W-well, we thought there might be monsters in the small town we're heading to, so I deployed some Public Security Force hunters from the reserves...」<br><br>I didn’t need to hear another word. Before I could berate him further, a massive explosion thundered from the city we were nearing.<br><br>Boom!<br><br>Flames surged and smoke billowed into the sky.<br><br>And then...<br><br>Ding.<br><br>A system notification for a sudden quest popped up.</p>
