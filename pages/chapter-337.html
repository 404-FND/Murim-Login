                        <p>Within a vast, frigid hall, a lantern perched on the windowsill wavered as the breeze outside slipped through a crevice in the window. Staring intently into the lantern's flickering light, I recalled the face of the old man I had spoken with hours ago.<br><br>He had eyes which radiated an eerie green and a form as gnarled as ancient timber.<br><br>This man bore the name Tang Sa-Dok, known colloquially as the Ten Thousand Poisons Shura.<br><br>He stood as the patriarch of the Tang Family of Sichuan, esteemed as one of the world's Five Great Families, and a recently bereaved son.<br><br>Whooooosh.<br><br>The brisk wind's howl against the sealed window seemed to carry the words he said to me.<br><br>'By the time I heard the news, it was already too late. There was not a single part of his body left unharmed.'<br><br>One God, Three Saints, Ten Kings.<br><br>These once valiant heroes, defenders against legions of demons, had inevitably aged into white-haired elders.<br><br>Some passed from age or ailment, others vanished in pursuit of tranquility, while a few stepped down, passing the mantle to their heirs.<br><br>Among them, the Poison King, Tang Sa-Mun, also ventured to carve his own destiny.<br><br>'Two days away, there is a place called Meishan. My father used to often speak of the beautiful mountains of Meishan.'<br><br>Twenty years prior, it seemed fated that the retired Poison King would gravitate towards Meishan.<br><br>Chosen as his final abode, a sanctuary for a martial artist who had navigated life's tumultuous currents.<br><br>'He didn’t like me coming to visit him. I had no choice but to send someone to check on him occasionally.'<br><br>This decision left behind a wound that would never heal.<br><br>Days ago, shocking news arrived.<br><br>Arriving in disbelief, Tang Sa-Dok was greeted by a grisly scene: remnants of a fierce struggle and his father’s lifeless form.<br><br>'Father’s body… was severely mutilated. It was undoubtedly the mark of torture.'<br><br>The motive behind the Poison King's torment remains unknown.<br><br>Yet, Tang Sa-Mun, the once-revered Transcendent Master, met a brutal end, victim to an unknown foe.<br><br>Enraged, Tang Sa-Dok spearheaded a search with his kin, but their efforts were in vain.<br><br>'I will find that scoundrel and kill him. I’ll tear him limb from limb, and scatter his remains across the Nine Provinces. His blood will flow into the Four Seas and Five Lakes.'<br><br>How could one respond to Tang Sa-Dok, brimming with such overwhelming vengeance? His fury and determination were palpable.<br><br>He, alongside the Tang Family of Sichuan, would relent only upon exacting retribution. Their assistance in locating the Divine Doctor was out of the question.<br><br>“The Poison King, Tang Sa-Mun, is dead. The Poison King…”<br><br>A monumental shift is underway, unfolding perilously close.<br><br>As I murmured this, fixated on the lantern, a hasty warning broke the silence.<br><br>“Be careful with your words. Do you have any idea what would happen if you said such a thing in the heart of the Tang Family of Sichuan?”<br><br>Recognizing the owner of the voice wasn't a difficult task. I had long sensed the approach of the Bermuda Triangle.<br><br>Without shifting my gaze, I replied.<br><br>"Have you finally come back?"<br><br>"Yeah of course we've come back, and be careful with your words. Watch your mouth!"<br><br>"It's fine. There's no one nearby."<br><br>"Just be careful, will you? Being with you always makes me nervous."<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang let out a sigh and collapsed into a chair. Cheong Pung and Hyuk Mu-Jin followed, each finding their own seat.<br><br>"Where have you been?"<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang's response was curt.<br><br>"The Beggar Sect Branch."<br><br>"Was Mun-Kyung with you?"<br><br>"No way. He's cooped up in a separate hall given by the Tang Family. I saw him earlier, so engrossed in the pharmacy he didn’t even notice anyone coming or going. Looks like he’ll stay the night and leave with us tomorrow."<br><br>"So, did you find out anything?"<br><br>"No, it was a waste of time. I subtly probed about the Tang Family of Sichuan, but even the branch head didn’t seem to know much."<br><br>This was not unexpected. Rumors suggested the Poison King’s abode lay in a secluded valley, accessible only to a select few dispatched covertly by Tang Sa-Dok.<br><br>'Moreover, if the Tang Family of Sichuan deliberately hid this...'<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok wanted to seek revenge using only his family's power.<br><br>Considering the strength and nature of the Tang Family of Sichuan, their current course of action wasn’t that strange.<br><br>"They did seem a bit wary, though. They said the Tang Family of Sichuan recently sent people asking for necessary information."<br><br>"They’ve already caught the scent. Did you tell them anything?"<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang paused momentarily before responding.<br><br>"Although Tang Sa-Dok has ordered silence... I am the successor of the Beggar Sect. I only told the truth to the branch head and instructed him to monitor anyone suspicious."<br><br>"And Young Master Cheong?"<br><br>Amidst the grave mood, Cheong Pung, stifling a yawn, replied.<br><br>"As Savior instructed, I sent a letter to my grandfather."<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang nodded and added,<br><br>"No matter how late, the news will reach within seven nights."<br><br>"Good, well done."<br><br>This was the least we could contribute.<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok might be furious if he finds out... but it was something I had to do.<br><br>“Uh, Squad Leader.”<br><br>“Hmm?”<br><br>Hyuk Mu-Jin cast a wary glance around before speaking.<br><br>“Can I ask you something?”<br><br>“If I say no, will you not ask?”<br><br>“No. You know I can’t hold back my curiosity.”<br><br>“……”<br><br>It’s remarkable how troubled I am already.<br><br>I thought about giving him a good smack for the first time in a while but restrained myself.<br><br>“What is it?”<br><br>“W-why are you clenching your fist like that? It’s scary.”<br><br>“Then don’t beat around the bush, just ask, you bastard.”<br><br>Hyuk Mu-Jin, eyeing my fist apprehensively, spoke in a hushed tone.<br><br>“Who is the murderer?”<br><br>“The murderer?”<br><br>“Yes, the one who tortured and killed the great Poison King, Tang Sa-Mun.”<br><br>“Ha, who's the murderer, huh?”<br><br>Whack!<br><br>“Ow! Why did you hit me!?”<br><br>“If I knew, would I be here, huh?”<br><br>Whack! Whack! Whack! Whack!<br><br>Unleashing a series of hits on the back of his head was unexpectedly cathartic.<br><br>“Ow, if you don’t know, just say you don’t know, why…”<br><br>“You’re talking nonsense, it’s infuriating.”<br><br>“Ouch. Quit it!”<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang glanced with contempt at Hyuk Mu-Jin, who was nursing his head and squirming.<br><br>“Tsk tsk, you're dumber than a street dog. How would he know who that bastard is and where they came from?”<br><br>Hyuk Mu-Jin, wiping away a tear, muttered.<br><br>“You, Young Master Goong, are usually spreading out a mat to beg next to that street dog, aren’t you?”<br><br>“What did you say!”<br><br>“Why? Did I say something wrong?”<br><br>“How dare you disrespect my sect!”<br><br>“It's said that even if your mouth is crooked, your words should be straight. Don't misunderstand. I was only disrespecting Young Master Goong.”<br><br>Cheong Pung burst into laughter, clapping his hands.<br><br>“Wow! Savior! Young Master Hyuk just disrespected Young Master Goong!”<br><br>“Stop laughing and help me out! Cheong Pung, you crazy bastard!”<br><br>That bastard Hyuk Mu-Jin has really improved his verbal skills.<br><br>I stepped in to block an infuriated Goong Gi-Bang, who was about to explode from being assaulted by facts.<br><br>“Both of you, calm down.”<br><br>Sensing that might not suffice, I added a stern warning.<br><br>“Unless you want to be beaten to death by me.”<br><br>“…….”<br><br>“…….”<br><br>That’s better.<br><br>Exhaling deeply, I observed the pair glaring at each other.<br><br>“Who knows who the murderer is. If they knew, the Tang Family of Sichuan would have caught and killed him long ago.”<br><br>Hyuk Mu-Jin, still not relaxing his gaze, said,<br><br>“I know that. What I meant was, isn’t there any guess or clue?”<br><br>“Think before you ask. Think. You dense motherfucker.”<br><br>“Oi! Where do you get the idea to speak informally to me? Do you think it’s okay to disrespect the Vice Leader of the Jin Family of Taiyuan's Jin Dragon Squad, just because you are the successor of the Beggar Sect? Right, Squad Leader?”<br><br>...Frankly, such formalities seem trivial in this context.<br><br>When I remained silent, Hyuk Mu-Jin narrowed his eyes.<br><br>I subtly steered the conversation elsewhere.<br><br>“Well, there are plenty of suspicious characters in Murim. Like those from Dark Heaven or the Demonic Cult.”<br><br>“Hmph! Is that all you think?”<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang, with a dismissive snort, seized control of the discourse.<br><br>“The Tang Family of Sichuan has put all their efforts into eradicating those who sided with the Demonic Cult. It could be the act of someone with a personal grudge.”<br><br>I asked while looking disgustedly at the booger clinging to Goong Gi-Bang’s nose.<br><br>“Weren’t the Demonic Cultists already completely wiped out?”<br><br>“No matter how much you sweep a yard, some sand remains. The world is so vast, how could there be no place to hide? There are those who survived despite the relentless pursuit.”<br><br>That makes sense.<br><br>Surviving the relentless hunt of the world-dominating Orthodox Sects would indeed indicate extraordinary prowess.<br><br>'Just like the Yin-Yang Twin Demons I encountered at Shaolin.'<br><br>Who could have predicted the reemergence of two assumed-dead Transcendent Demon Heads in Shaolin?<br><br>Murim is a labyrinth of complex interconnections, a breeding ground for unexpected events.<br><br>'And to add torture into the mix.'<br><br>There are generally two reasons for torture:<br><br>To inflict pain before killing, or to extract some desired information from the victim.<br><br>While the exact intent eludes me, one aspect is clear.<br><br>'...A dangerously vile character has emerged.'<br><br>Certainly, a force I'd prefer to avoid encountering, even inadvertently.<br><br>Presently, I stand at the zenith of the Peak Realm. Although enlightenment eludes me, my strength, augmented by the System, enables me to confront early-stage Transcendent Masters.<br><br>'The Tai Yi Ruthless Sword Hwang Bo-Eom is a prime example.'<br><br>Yet, a confrontation with a master superior to him would pose a formidable challenge. If not for a moment of revelation during my duel with Hwang Bo-Eom's Tai Yi Spectral Sword, defeat could have been my fate.<br><br>Especially against a Master capable of vanquishing the Poison King, ranked among the top five of the Ten Kings...<br><br>'It would be a certain defeat for me now.'<br><br>A bitter truth, but one I must acknowledge.<br><br>Engrossed in my thoughts, Goong Gi-Bang abruptly interjected, as if struck by a sudden realization.<br><br>“Come to think of it, the murderer could be a professional assassin.”<br><br>“A professional assassin?”<br><br>“Is there another kind of assassin?”<br><br>I frowned.<br><br>“Are those guys really that skilled?”<br><br>“I don't know. I've heard from my master that the leader of the Moonlight Shadow Vale has killed three Transcendent Masters so far.” \[Note: the direct translation is Moon Shadow Assassin Valley, but this sounds more poetic.\]<br><br>“...A single assassin has killed three Transcendent Masters?”<br><br>“Absolutely. It caused a major uproar in the Murim.”<br><br>“Then is that leader, whoever they are, the number one assassin in the world or something?”<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang stared at me as though I were deranged.<br><br>“What are you talking about? The number one assassin ranking could only ever be held by one person.”<br><br>“Ah.”<br><br>I had momentarily forgotten.<br><br>The existence of those revered as the Sword Saint, the Bow Saint, and notably, the one referred to as the Dark Saint. \[Note: the Dark Saint is listed as Slaughter Saint in a previous chapter and on the Wiki, but that sounds a bit aggressive. There isn't really a great way to say "a Saint who assassinates people" like there is for "a Saint who uses a sword".\]<br><br>'I initially thought he was called the Dark Saint just because he had killed many people.'<br><br>But it turned out, his primary occupation was indeed being an assassin.<br><br>According to what I heard from Jeok Cheon-Gang, he had taken countless lives, indiscriminately killing both good and evil, so much so that he was once considered a public enemy of Murim.<br><br>'At least, until the Great Faction War broke out.'<br><br>His relentless eradication of evil Masters shifted public perception; those who once vilified him had no choice but to grant a pardon, dubbing him the Dark Saint.<br><br>“Of course, it’s unlikely that the Dark Saint killed Master Tang Sa-Mun, but the Tang Family of Sichuan will surely consider this possibility.”<br><br>“It’s regrettable, but they will handle it themselves.”<br><br>Regardless of the murderer’s identity, my primary objective remains to locate the Divine Doctor for Jeok Cheon-Gang.<br><br>While it's disheartening not to garner support from the Tang Family of Sichuan, I still have the Qingcheng and Emei Sects. Two factions yet to explore.<br><br>So...<br><br>“Young Master Goong. Is that booger on your nose something you’re saving for a midnight snack?”<br><br>“What did you say!”<br><br>“Hahaha! Savior is saying you’re going to eat your booger as a snack!”<br><br>…Seriously, these guys.<br><br>At my wits' end, I upended the table.<br><br>“Get out! We need to leave early tomorrow, so go get some sleep!”<br><br>Having dispersed the Bermuda Triangle, I collapsed into a chair.<br><br>Gazing blankly at the quivering lantern, I murmured softly.<br><br>“Inventory Open, Summon.”<br><br>Thump.<br><br>A tiny, jade-hued porcelain shard materialized in my hand.<br><br>When I flipped over the \[Token of the Divine Doctor\], faint letters revealed themselves.<br><br>\[Wu Bei Zi is best when it comes from Sichuan land.\]<br><br>Wu Bei Zi... seriously? Couldn’t they have just written down an address?</p>
