                        <p>A suit of armor glimmered, its surface polished to a lustrous sheen. Its dark green cloak fluttered like ethereal wings and purple, ghostly flames flickered in its vacant eye sockets.<br><br>Then, a voice pierced the silence.<br><br>\- Come. Down. Hu. Man.<br><br>The voice, grating like metal against stone, echoed. I teetered on the edge of the tree branch.<br><br>'Did it just speak?'<br><br>This wasn't an entirely foreign experience. The wyvern I encountered before, the infamous 'One-Eyed Carus,' had spoken too.<br><br>Yet, the notion of a speaking monster remained a startling rarity.<br><br>“A Named Monster…”<br><br>The words slipped from my lips, a whisper tinged with disbelief.<br><br>Indeed, it was said that only the so-called Named Monsters possessed the gift of speech.<br><br>And right before my eyes, a Named Monster was born.<br><br>No, not born – it had 'evolved'.<br><br>\[Lv.105 Skeleton Warlord\]<br><br>Evolution, huh? I've never heard or seen a Named Monster do this.<br><br>'What is this, Digimon?'<br><br>Doubt clouded my mind. Was this creature truly a monster? Capable of evolution?<br><br>Even I, light years away from an ordinary life, felt a surge of surprise. The guild members' reactions were beyond imagining.<br><br>“What's that?”<br><br>“Wait, did it just speak?”<br><br>“I've never seen anything like that in the Monster Encyclopedia…”<br><br>Of course.<br><br>Named Monsters are anomalies, each with unique traits and unpredictable power. Their emergence always brings the unknown.<br><br>'But why now?'<br><br>I licked my dry lips.<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord's true power was unknown, yet its aura screamed of a Named Monster's might.<br><br>'Plus, there are two A-rank Skeleton Knights.'<br><br>Around them, a horde: 150 B-rank Skeleton Mages and Warriors, collectively as daunting as an army.<br><br>However, targeting the Warlord and its core force, the Skeleton Knights, might tip the scales.<br><br>'I’ve been non-stop raiding up until now.'<br><br>Currently, only about fifty members of our guild have passed through the gate.<br><br>Yet, more than half are battle-hardened warriors, sculpted by training sessions akin to traversing through hell itself.<br><br>After a week of relentless encounters with skeletons, these seasoned fighters could likely withstand adversaries double, perhaps triple, their number.<br><br>'The new recruits also have outstanding basic skills.'<br><br>Only the finest were selected, lured by salaries rivaling those of the larger guilds.<br><br>This recruitment cycle, I took a direct hand in the process, evaluating interviews and various assessments, meticulously gauging their potential for growth.<br><br>It was akin to handpicking the sturdiest saplings, those capable of weathering the Ares Guild's storm, and planting them firmly in the Peace Guild's front lawn.<br><br>'It's worth taking a bit of a risk.'<br><br>Mr. Choi and others had temporarily abandoned their guild responsibilities, dedicating themselves to mastering the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique.<br><br>Their presence would have simplified the battle, but even if they were here, I wouldn't have called them to arms.<br><br>A hidden blade wields its deadliest force from the shadows. It must remain concealed, especially in a place swarming with prying eyes.<br><br>With my thoughts concluded, I summoned a member.<br><br>"Jin-Soo!"<br><br>"Yes!"<br><br>Kim Jin-Soo, effectively my second-in-command, responded promptly. I gestured towards the Skeleton Warlord with my dagger.<br><br>Its eye sockets, still ablaze with ghostly flames, seemed to fixate on me.<br><br>“That's a Named Monster.”<br><br>A wave of gasps and tense swallowing resonated amongst the guild members.<br><br>Many were novices, their hunting careers spanning less than two years. Their faces were etched with apprehension, confronting a Named Monster – a rarity even for veterans of two decades.<br><br>But Kim Jin-Soo's reaction was distinct. He absorbed the shock quickly, nodding with composed acknowledgment.<br><br>“I see.”<br><br>"Look at you, acting all calm."<br><br>“To be honest, I'm a bit shocked, but we can't just stand here and be taken by surprise, can we?"<br><br>Look at this guy.<br><br>His bravery was apparent from the beginning, but displaying such valor in his first year was extraordinary.<br><br>Feeling my gaze, Kim Jin-Soo allowed a faint smile and added,<br><br>"If the situation were desperate, you would have signaled a retreat long ago, right? Am I wrong?"<br><br>“Hmm.”<br><br>"…Uh, did I miss something?"<br><br>“No.”<br><br>I let out a chuckle, shaking my head.<br><br>“You’re right. This is a fight worth taking on.”<br><br>“Ah.”<br><br>“I'll take those three over there. The rest are yours. How long do you think you can hold them off?”<br><br>After a brief moment of thought, Kim Jin-Soo replied.<br><br>“The new guys lack experience, but still... we should be able to hold out for about an hour.”<br><br>"An hour?"<br><br>"Yes. At least an hour."<br><br>Kim Jin-Soo’s reply was laced with confidence. Just then, the Skeleton Warlord slowly opened its gaping maw, unleashing a sound so strange and unnerving, it defied description.<br><br>\- Gr․ ah, ah․ ah. Ah!<br><br>Ding!<br><br>\- \[Lv.105 Skeleton Warlord\] has used a special skill!<br><br>\- Special Skill, \[Summon the Dead\] has been activated!<br><br>\- The dormant dead heed their commander's call!<br><br>A ghastly wail reverberated, a sound that seemed to rouse the accursed dead.<br><br>Thud, thud-thud-thud!<br><br>The ground convulsed, quaking under our feet. Countless pale skeletons burst forth from the earth, rapidly forming ranks.<br><br>Skeletons armed with dirt-encrusted bone swords and wooden shields, still bearing roots. Mages adorned with skull-themed necklaces stood amidst the throng of Skeleton Warriors.<br><br>Even the A-rank Monsters, the Skeleton Knights, swelled in their numbers.<br><br>With this new emergence, the skeleton forces now numbered well over 300.<br><br>"..."<br><br>"..."<br><br>In the ensuing silence, I finally spoke up.<br><br>“Jin-Soo.”<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"An hour, can you do it?"<br><br>"Uh, well..."<br><br>“Be honest.”<br><br>“...Maybe closer to 30 minutes.”<br><br>“Really?”<br><br>“Yes. The situation has worsened, but we should manage.”<br><br>Kim Jin-Soo said with a grim face as he looked at the Skeleton Warlord.<br><br>“That is, if that thing doesn't pull any more tricks.”<br><br>“It probably will.”<br><br>“You think so?"<br><br>\- Gr․ ah, ah, ah. Ah!<br><br>“See? Told you."<br><br>Kim Jin-Soo sighed.<br><br>“Hah, please."<br><br>Ding.<br><br>\- \[Lv.105 Skeleton Warlord\] has used a special skill!<br><br>\- Special Skill, \[Commander's Battle Cry\] has been activated!<br><br>\- Under the command of the Skeleton Warlord, the strength, agility, and magic of the monsters have been enhanced!<br><br>\- The enemy’s momentum has greatly increased!<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord’s roar thundered through the air.<br><br>Its impact was tremendous.<br><br>"Wow…”<br><br>Utilizing \[Qi Sense\], I observed that each monster had gained 5 levels.<br><br>The aura emanating from the now 300-strong skeleton army was formidable, a stark contrast to their prior state.<br><br>Turning, I caught Kim Jin-Soo’s dazed expression.<br><br>"Still think 30 minutes is feasible?”<br><br>“.......”<br><br>His eyes spoke volumes, silently cursing me.<br><br>Even I had to admit the situation was dire. Without delay, I issued the next command.<br><br>"Retreat slowly. Don’t provoke them."<br><br>“How far should we retreat?"<br><br>“To the trail right in front of the gate. Stay ready to escape anytime.”<br><br>“The trail is narrow, so it will be easier to fight.”<br><br>“Exactly."<br><br>Kim Jin-Soo was right; the trail leading to the gate was so confined that only about five men could pass through it side by side.<br><br>Even for skeletons, inherently slender in build, only about seven or eight could squeeze through the narrow trail at once.<br><br>Yet, there was a change in plan...<br><br>“Actually, just get out of here."<br><br>A frontal assault was no longer an option.<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“Take the kids and get out through the gate.”<br><br>Upon hearing my command, confusion washed over Kim Jin-Soo’s face.<br><br>“Then what about you, Sunbae...”<br><br>“You think I'll be playing tag with them while you guys are leaving? Someone needs to buy time."<br><br>“Sunbae! That's dangerous!"<br><br>“Jin-Soo. No, dear members of the Peace Guild."<br><br>I gazed down solemnly at the fifty guild members, their faces turned up towards me like baby birds.<br><br>“In our Peace Guild, the safety of our members is always our top priority.”<br><br>Some of the more seasoned fighters muttered under their breath.<br><br>“That's the biggest nonsense I've heard this year.”<br><br>“I think I almost died seven times this week.”<br><br>“I'm at about ten.”<br><br>The rookies, fresh on their first day, had eyes shimmering with fear.<br><br>"Sunbae!"<br><br>"Ah, damn it!"<br><br>“To go to these lengths for us…!”<br><br>My voice grew heavy with emotion.<br><br>“For your safety, I'll face any peril. Even if it costs me my arms! Even if my legs are severed! I vow to see each of you safely returned to your families!"<br><br>A fervor ignited among some members.<br><br>“We can fight!"<br><br>“Let us fight with you!"<br><br>I clenched my teeth, shaking my head resolutely.<br><br>“I cannot permit it! In times like these, sacrifice is inevitable, and I must be the one to step forward."<br><br>“But still……!”<br><br>Swoosh! Shush!<br><br>Before any further objections could be raised, a sinister black aura surged forth.<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord, towering at a colossal height, cleaved through a massive tree with a circumference of several meters. Its voice echoed like the scrape of metal on stone.<br><br>\- I. Will. Destroy. Kill. Obliterate․ You. All!<br><br>Swoosh, thud!<br><br>I jumped down from the tree and shouted.<br><br>“Everyone, return to the gate! I’ll cover the rear!"<br><br>This time, there were no dissenting voices. The skeletal army, now numbering over 300, began their relentless march.<br><br>Clatter, thump, clatter, thump.<br><br>Their approach, bolstered by the Warlord’s special skill, resonated with formidable force.<br><br>A ghostly light flickered within their hollow skulls.<br><br>\- Roaaaaar!<br><br>The Skeleton Knight, resembling a deputy commander, unleashed a fierce roar. Rusted arrows and spells of offense flew from their ranks, aimed directly at the Peace Guild members.<br><br>Whish, whish, whoosh!<br><br>"Defend!"<br><br>“Tanks! Don’t lower your shields, retreat slowly!"<br><br>“Commence covering fire!"<br><br>The gap between us spanned roughly 300 paces. A strategic withdrawal required expanding this distance.<br><br>I wielded White Flames, confronting the monster's vanguard.<br><br>"You fiends! Dare to attack our precious Peace Guild members!"<br><br>Swish, crack!<br><br>My spear, surging with energy, shattered bones effortlessly. The spear's radiant energy cleaved through the air, felling ten foes in a single strike.<br><br>Then, three Skeleton Knights bore down on me simultaneously.<br><br>\- Growl!<br><br>\- Roar!<br><br>Swish!<br><br>Three streaks of dark aura grazed past, the wind pressure leaving a wound on my neck.<br><br>Despairing cries from the guild members, now fleeing down the trail, filled the air.<br><br>"Ah! Sunbae!"<br><br>"It’s dangerous!"<br><br>Clank, clank, clang!<br><br>I deflected the incoming attacks with unyielding determination, my voice firm and commanding.<br><br>“Go ahead! I’ll be right behind you!"<br><br>“But……!"<br><br>“Jin-Soo! Hurry up and go!”<br><br>After a brief internal struggle, Kim Jin-Soo rallied the guild members toward the gate, his voice resonating with urgency.<br><br>"You have to make it back!”<br><br>I offered a faint nod and a reassuring smile.<br><br>“Okay.”<br><br>"I’m sorry, Sunbae!”<br><br>"It’s fine. Just go!”<br><br>“Sob!”<br><br>Kim Jin-Soo's form, laden with reluctance, vanished beyond the gate's threshold.<br><br>Left alone, I stood amidst a sea of skeletons crowding the narrow trail.<br><br>\- So. Fool. Ish. Human.<br><br>Creak!<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord emerged, parting the skeletal ranks like a macabre tide.<br><br>\- Are. You. Pre. Pared. To. Die. Hu. Man?<br><br>I paid no heed to its taunts.<br><br>Only after a thorough sweep of the area, ensuring everyone's safe passage, did I exhale in relief.<br><br>“Phew, they’re finally safe.”<br><br>\- ......What?<br><br>“Those kids are too sensitive. When the team leader says to run, they should just bolt. What help could they offer? Right?”<br><br>I dabbed at the blood trickling from my neck. I tried to control it, but the cut was deeper than I thought. Maybe about 0.2 centimeters?<br><br>“Ah, damn. What a waste of blood.”<br><br>The Warlord's eerie purple flames flickered uncertainly.<br><br>\- What. The․ Hell. Are. You. Schem. Ing?<br><br>“Nothing out of the ordinary.”<br><br>My smirk was barely concealed as I surveyed the skeleton army, a legion of seasoned cadavers, crammed into the confined space.<br><br>“You all are going to die here. That’s all you need to know."<br><br>\- What. Did. You. Say?<br><br>Rather than offering a verbal response, I inhaled deeply, centering myself.<br><br>Every muscle in my body tensed, ready for action, as the fiery dragon residing within my dantian responded to the intricate maneuvers of the Scorching Sun Divine Arts.<br><br>In the next instant, I became a seamless extension of the spear in my grasp, propelling myself forward with a singular purpose.<br><br>"One Strike."<br><br>Kwaahhh!</p>
