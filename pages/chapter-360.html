                        <p>I don't know how much time has passed.<br><br>While time seemed to drag on painfully slowly, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's attacks were as fast and rough as the rapids of the Yangtze River I had seen weeks ago.<br><br>Time continued to pass by as I stood motionless.<br><br>Thud!<br><br>His movements were a blur, and before realization could dawn, an impact sent my head reeling backward.<br><br>Before regaining my balance, a cacophony of splitting sounds assaulted my ears.<br><br>Whoosh, thud! Thud-thud-thud!<br><br>Shoulder, chest, abdomen. A series of strikes, imbued with Qi, flowed like water as they pounded my upper body.<br><br>As my bones cracked, a white-hot agony engulfed my vision, and I clenched my teeth in pain.<br><br>With a sharp crack, the shattering of my molars momentarily jolted me back to reality.<br><br>"Aaagh!"<br><br>Whoosh!<br><br>With a guttural scream, I launched a desperate punch, only to have the Western Heavenly Demon Lord easily intercept my sluggish effort.<br><br>"Do you still have strength left?"<br><br>"……!"<br><br>Crack!<br><br>Even my steel-like muscles and bones proved brittle against his might.<br><br>His claw-like grip seized and twisted my wrist, mercilessly crushing the flesh and bones.<br><br>Pain exploded as my already damaged left arm crumbled further.<br><br>"Aaaargh!"<br><br>"Don't worry. I'll call some skilled healers later to treat you."<br><br>"Fuck... you!"<br><br>Blood spat from my lips, coating my face, as I lunged with my remaining strength.<br><br>A faint spear Qi, wrapped around the tip of White Flames, stabbed towards the lower body of the bastard.<br><br>Swoosh. Click.<br><br>Yet my attack was effortlessly thwarted.<br><br>Not by Black Dragon Armor or a Protective Qi, but by the bare hand of the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>"Futile efforts."<br><br>Dark Qi enveloped his hand, which tightened around the spear tip, extinguishing the gathered energy as if swallowed by the void.<br><br>"Give up. The outcome won't change anyway."<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord whispered, drawing my spear closer.<br><br>Gripping the spear shaft with hands torn and bloodstained, I resisted.<br><br>The pain was sharp, yet tolerable.<br><br>After all, I have been through enough pain in the past.<br><br>Whoosh, thud!<br><br>I stumbled forward, tasting a mix of dirt and blood.<br><br>Curiously, the dank, odorous floor of the dungeon now seemed a haven of comfort.<br><br>'I'm exhausted.'<br><br>If I close my eyes now, it feels like I could fall asleep right away.<br><br>Maybe I won't be in Murim but in the modern era when I wake up.<br><br>A plush seat on a private jet heading to Sichuan, China, would be nice, but so would my stinky, single room in the Hope Dormitory. \[Note: this is the place that the MC was staying at in the beginning chapters with his Hyung, Jin-Ho.\]<br><br>'Maybe all of this was a dream.'<br><br>I have experienced too much over the past year.<br><br>From Jin Tae-Kyung, the F-rank hunter, to the shame of the Jin Family of Taiyuan. Then from the shame of the family to the Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi.<br><br>I've seen horrific wars and countless deaths, and met many people.<br><br>From Jin Wi-Kyung, who would die for his youngest brother, to Jin Mu-Kyung, who would kill his younger brother. Hyuk Mu-Jin, who always stood by my side through life and death and ups and downs, and Cheong Pung, my friend and my most formidable rival at the same time.<br><br>And...<br><br>'Grandfather.'<br><br>My heavy eyelids paused their descent.<br><br>Right, the Fire King Jeok Cheon-Gang.<br><br>He is behind me. I am supposed to be protecting him.<br><br>That's why I can't fall down or run away.<br><br>'You foolish bastard. Tae-Kyung, run away!'<br><br>'H-hyung...'<br><br>'Go ahead. I'll be right behind you.' \[Note: this exchange is from the Sangdong District Gate incident when the MC's team faced One-Eyed Carus and everyone died. The manhwa flashes back to this moment in chapter 30, but the raw Korean for the conversation in this moment is different. The manhwa just has the leader telling the MC to run.\]<br><br>It's already been three years, but the memory of that day will never be erased.<br><br>I failed to protect the people precious to me and survived because of their sacrifice.<br><br>Yet, despite my newfound power, I continued to make old mistakes.<br><br>'The Ghostly Dance of the Fire God. Wasn’t it spectacular?'<br><br>At that moment, Jeok Cheon-Gang's laughter filled the air.<br><br>His laughter carried the triumph of avenging a beloved friend and the satisfaction of protecting someone.<br><br>"It was amazing."<br><br>My voice, barely a whisper, emerged through swollen, torn lips.<br><br>The dungeon's icy, putrid floor suddenly lost its appeal.<br><br>I began to stand, the chill and odor now repellant.<br><br>Using my relatively unharmed right arm for support, I struggled to my knees, my body threatening to collapse.<br><br>Despite the sluggish, painful effort, I persevered.<br><br>Upon standing, I was greeted by the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's piercing gaze.<br><br>"Impressive. Foolishly so."<br><br>Thud!<br><br>My nose broke, and my head snapped back. But I did not falter or retreat.<br><br>I remained upright, anchored by the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's grip on my shoulder.<br><br>"How many times have I told you? It's already over."<br><br>Crunch.<br><br>My shoulder blade gave way, the spear slipping from my weakened grasp.<br><br>Surely, intense pain should follow, but the pain I actually felt was faint.<br><br>"If you're waiting for help, you're mistaken. The Tang Family of Sichuan is doomed to be annihilated. By now, everything might already be over."<br><br>Crack!<br><br>This time, it was my legs. The shins of my somewhat intact legs broke simultaneously, and I lost my balance.<br><br>Ironically, the reason I could still stand was because the Western Heavenly Demon Lord did not let go of me.<br><br>"Who could help you like the last time in Hanam? The Sword Saint, who will hear of this only after a fortnight? His disciple struggling upstairs? Or perhaps..."<br><br>His gaze drifted.<br><br>Past the wreckage of our battle, to a sealed iron door.<br><br>"Your master, who still hasn't regained consciousness?"<br><br>"Cough."<br><br>"Nothing will change. Today, the Tang Family, Qingcheng Sect, and Emei Sect will all be annihilated. All of you..."<br><br>"Cough!"<br><br>His proclamation halted abruptly.<br><br>A viscous blend of dirt and blood splattered his face, silencing him.<br><br>His surprise was palpable, not anticipating such defiance from someone so grievously injured.<br><br>In a fleeting moment, I mustered all my remaining strength for a headbutt, catching him by surprise as he held my neck.<br><br>Thud!<br><br>The sound of impact echoed as the Western Heavenly Demon Lord staggered backward.<br><br>Depleted of Qi and racked with internal injuries, the origin of this burst of strength was as mysterious to me as it was unexpected.<br><br>But...<br><br>'I don't even have the energy to think about it.'<br><br>That was the last of my desperate struggles.<br><br>Rubbing his forehead, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord chuckled.<br><br>"You really are...dangerous...my friend."<br><br>Weakly, I retorted,<br><br>"That should have cracked your skull."<br><br>"Had I not summoned my Protective Qi at the last moment, it might have."<br><br>"Monster."<br><br>"Huh, hearing such words from you makes me feel peculiar."<br><br>In his gaze were a mix of emotions towards me.<br><br>Perhaps it was anger mixed with respect?<br><br>Yet, before I could decipher his feelings, an abrupt clamor shattered the silence.<br><br>Rumble, boom!<br><br>The source of the sound was not from me or the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>The underground prison trembled. Fist-sized stones fell from the ceiling, and the ground cracked open slightly.<br><br>The disturbance was brief, yet it left the Western Heavenly Demon Lord visibly concerned.<br><br>"...I should hurry."<br><br>With those words, he glanced briefly at the ceiling. At that instant, heaven and earth seemed to flip, and a small shock was transmitted through my back.<br><br>Thump!<br><br>He had thrown me against the wall.<br><br>His voice, steady yet distant, followed as I spat blood.<br><br>"Just sit there for a while. I'll be back soon."<br><br>"You..."<br><br>"If you're still alive by then, I'll take you with me, but if you happen to be dead..."<br><br>In the ensuing quiet, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord added,<br><br>"That wouldn't be bad either. You are indeed a dangerous person."<br><br>"Wait, stop."<br><br>Desperately, I reached out towards the diminishing figure of the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>It was imperative to stop him, to safeguard Jeok Cheon-Gang and the Divine Doctor from capture.<br><br>Yet, my body failed to respond to my desperate command.<br><br>"Cough. Queeck!"<br><br>A dark red mixture of blood spilled from my gaping mouth.<br><br>The lumps mixed in... Damn it. They're pieces of my intestines.<br><br>It was neither a new sight nor an unexpected one, but a deep sense of despair weighed heavily on my entire body.<br><br>My limbs were rendered useless, and I had sustained critical internal injuries.<br><br>My heart was set on blocking the path of the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, but with my broken arms and legs, I couldn't move a single step.<br><br>"Ah."<br><br>With a groan, I slowly raised my head.<br><br>The corridor, devastated by our clash, was empty, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's figure gone.<br><br>What once held prisoners now lay in ruins, marked by craters and the debris of collapsed walls.<br><br>Chains and bars that had once restrained, now lay broken among the rubble, a testament to the ferocity of our encounter.<br><br>In that moment, the grim reality settled in.<br><br>'It's over.'<br><br>I fought and lost.<br><br>I tried to block him, but I couldn't. I tried to protect them, but I couldn't.<br><br>The words of the Western Heavenly Demon Lord were true.<br><br>The luck of Hanam would not repeat itself. The doom of the Tang Family, Emei Sect, and Qingcheng Sect seemed inevitable, and Cheong Pung alone could not avert it.<br><br>'He might die or get captured.'<br><br>I hoped he would escape, but that was unlikely to happen.<br><br>Because that's who Cheong Pung is: the kind of person who would return to the underground prison, even on the verge of death, to save his Savior.<br><br>Gazing towards the bleak exit, a bitter chuckle broke from me.<br><br>'Damn it...'<br><br>The weight of blame pressed heavily, for dragging Cheong Pung, Jeok Cheon-Gang, and the Divine Doctor into this dire situation felt squarely upon my shoulders.<br><br>Yet, a semblance of solace came with the thought that Hyuk Mu-Jin and Goong Gi-Bang were spared from this fate.<br><br>Rumble, rumble.<br><br>The ground trembled, a deep resonance from below stirring the air with faint vibrations.<br><br>It was the sound signaling the end of the match.<br><br>There was no need to go up to 12 rounds like in boxing. I fell in just 3, and I am probably going to die soon.<br><br>'I'm sorry everyone.'<br><br>A simple rule was written in the capsule's user manual.<br><br>If you die in Murim, you also die in reality.<br><br>Everything I had built across these two worlds was crumbling down, bit by bit, just like this underground prison.<br><br>"I didn't expect to die like this..."<br><br>My vision blurred. The pain I felt throughout my body and the sounds that reached my ears were all slowly fading away.<br><br>And at that moment, when I was about to lose all of my senses, the face of an old man suddenly entered my view.<br><br>Shackles, freshly broken, framed his gaunt form, his skeletal frame starkly outlined.<br><br>With the last remnants of my strength, I called out to him.<br><br>"...Heavenly Force Demon."</p>
