Choi Min-Woo, having decapitated it cleanly, barely had time to breathe before ducking.</p><p>Whoosh! Crunch!</p><p>It was a narrow escape.</p><p>A sinister, magic-infused axe blade swept past Choi Min-Woo, obliterating the skulls of two nearby orcs.</p><p>The headless knight, a Dullahan, continued to pour attacks toward the human in front of him without a moment's hesitation despite having slain his own kind.</p><p>Squeeak! Screech!</p><p>- Crunch!</p><p>"Cough!"</p><p>A massive halberd swept through, indiscriminately slicing through both human and monster alike.</p><p>Only with three hunters of equal rank was the A-rank monster, the Dullahan, considered manageable.</p><p>Yet, Choi Min-Woo, sliding out of harm’s way, swiftly counterattacked without any trepidation.</p><p>'Now!'</p><p>He took a quick breath and then struck like lightning.</p><p>Thwack!</p><p>His sword, imbued with three types of magic and crafted by a master, pierced the Dullahan's shoulder.</p><p>Though it felt no pain, the undead creature’s body was still human.</p><p>As the muscles and tendons of its right arm were severed, the halberd fell from its weakening grip. Choi Min-Woo seized this moment.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The brilliant white aura sliced through the Dullahan's waist. The creature spewed rotten blood from its disintegrating body, splattering Choi Min-Woo's face.</p><p>He remained unflinching, despite the overpowering stench assaulting his senses.</p><p>In the thick of battle, Choi Min-Woo was consumed by the tension around him, his clinical rationality, and a burgeoning thrill.</p><p>'Ten.'</p><p>That was the tally of A-rank monsters he had dispatched single-handedly today. Counting the lower-ranked ones, the number soared past fifty.</p><p>'Was I always capable of this?'</p><p>If he were to answer that question honestly, the answer would be no.</p><p>Whether or not the monsters were empowered by the Arch Lich, it was unequivocal that those he encountered in China were inherently stronger and more ferocious.</p><p>Yet, Choi Min-Woo was able to excel in this chaotic battle due to two strokes of luck.</p><p>First.</p><p>'The Jin Family Cultivation Technique.'</p><p>A mana cultivation technique personally taught by Jin Tae-Kyung.</p><p>Choi Min-Woo harbored some doubts about Jin Tae-Kyung's claims that it was a treasured heirloom passed down through his family, but he had no doubts about its excellence as a secret technique.</p><p>This technique allowed Choi Min-Woo to stabilize and distribute his energy efficiently, bolstering him with a seemingly inexhaustible vitality thanks to the immense mana accumulated during his training.</p><p>As for the second stroke of luck...</p><p>- Roar!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A steel reinforcement bar, swinging with ferocious force, shattered the cement beneath.</p><p>Propelling off the thick arm of an ogre, Choi Min-Woo leaped and drove his sword downward with full force.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>The blade, charged with aura, split the ogre's skull effortlessly.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>The massive four-meter tall creature slumped to its knees. Perched on its shoulders, Choi Min-Woo swiftly surveyed the chaos.</p><p>'It's gone.'</p><p>Amidst the cries and rampant death, the scene was hellish.</p><p>Yet, the monster, the leader of the Death Knights and the monster legion, who showed immense strength at the battle's onset, was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>'Where on earth could it be?'</p><p>The image of the Black Knight, annihilating dozens of hunters with a single blow, was vivid in his memory.</p><p>Had that creature fully engaged, the humans might have been obliterated within half an hour.</p><p>However, for some unknown reason, the Black Knight had vanished since then.</p><p>Did the monster's arrogance lead it to believe this battle unworthy of its intervention?</p><p>For Choi Min-Woo, this inexplicable oversight presented both a second stroke of luck and a decisive moment.</p><p>'We must retreat.'</p><p>Urban warfare had become futile. The monster legion, numbering ten thousand, had overrun the city like a tidal wave, including roughly a hundred A-rank monsters.</p><p>In terms of numbers and strength, the battle was unwinnable.</p><p>Nearly half of the thousand Public Security Force hunters defending the front lines were either dead or wounded, and the People's Liberation Army had deserted, discarding their weapons even before the monsters arrived.</p><p>The armored units, reduced to scrap metal, and the air force, fallen prey to aerial monsters, were both deemed as lost causes.</p><p>Ratatatata, Boom!</p><p>A state-of-the-art combat helicopter spiraled out of control and erupted in flames. The soldiers, hit by flying debris, died without a sound.</p><p>While the scene was gruesome, their deaths were mercifully quick.</p><p>Then, the monstrous horde began to obliterate everything in its path.</p><p>- Roaaar!</p><p>Whoosh, thump!</p><p>The front paw of a Saber Tiger, exerting immense force, crushed limbs and shattered skulls.</p><p>The slower People's Liberation Army soldiers were overwhelmed; their rifles were as effective as slingshots against these monsters.</p><p>Faced with the relentless carnage, Choi Min-Woo gritted his teeth.</p><p>'Snap out of it. We can't save everyone.'</p><p>He was not a hypocrite thanking others for their sacrifices to the greater good. Instead, he coldly faced the reality of this fight and prepared to become a villain to the soldiers around him.</p><p>'If he had come, could we have stopped them?'</p><p>Thoughts of Jin Tae-Kyung surfaced, mingled with futile regrets.</p><p>Despite frantic attempts to contact him through a communications officer, there was no reply.</p><p>The planned ambush had completely severed communications.</p><p>At this point, all Choi Min-Woo could hope for was that one of the many "bottles thrown into the sea" would reach Jin Tae-Kyung.</p><p>Thwack!</p><p>As Choi Min-Woo plunged his sword into the chest of a charging Minotaur, he shouted.</p><p>"Shao Shen!"</p><p>His mana-infused shout cut through the chaos, reaching one person.</p><p>Despite his current state of battered and bloodied yet still battling the onslaught, Shao Shen roared back.</p><p>「Speak!」</p><p>"Disengage the Public Security Forces. We need to retreat immediately!"</p><p>「Excuse me? But if we retreat now...」</p><p>Choi Min-Woo anticipated the young hunter's next words.</p><p>The highest casualties often occur during the ensuing pursuit after a retreat.</p><p>Particularly now, if the hunters, serving as the last line of defense, withdrew, the People's Liberation Army would be overtaken by the monster legion.</p><p>"If we are surrounded, it's all over. Do you understand? Even now, the surviving hunters and the rear units must pave our way out of the city!"</p><p>「…Mr. Choi.」</p><p>"I know what you're thinking. But this is the only option left to us."</p><p>「…!」</p><p>Shao Shen involuntarily squeezed his eyes shut.</p><p>He was acutely aware of their dire predicament, perhaps more so than any others.</p><p>As the battle initiated, the tide turned swiftly against them, driving the humans to a commandeered hospital serving as a makeshift headquarters. Should the monsters complete their encirclement...</p><p>'Annihilation.'</p><p>His deliberation was lengthy, but the decision came in an instant.</p><p>Reopening his eyes, Shao Shen parried a barrage of attacks with all his strength and commanded.</p><p>「Retreat! All units of the Public Security Forces, retreat immediately! The North Gate is unoccupied!」</p><p>In war, the command of a leader like Shao Shen is absolute.</p><p>Especially if neither General Liao nor any of the military leadership were around to show their faces.</p><p>'That's it.'</p><p>Though the outcome for the soldiers was uncertain, hunters stood a better chance of survival. If Shao Shen’s decision proved correct, many might escape the encirclement.</p><p>'Yes, this settles it.'</p><p>A sense of relief washed over Choi Min-Woo as he surged forward.</p><p>Not towards the north, which remained clear of monsters, but towards the besieged People's Liberation Army.</p><p>'It feels like a suicide mission.'</p><p>Why he chose this path was beyond his own understanding.</p><p>Yet, facing his end felt strangely...right.</p><p>Perhaps it was the gathering dark clouds, the biting wind, or the comfort of not dying alone that made it seem less terrifying.</p><p>Suddenly, Choi Min-Woo spoke to his companion.</p><p>"Why didn't you retreat?"</p><p>Shao Shen, who should have been making for the North Gate, cracked a weary smile.</p><p>「Why didn't you?」</p><p>"…I asked first."</p><p>「Then I should answer first. Public Security Forces!」</p><p>At their leader's call, the three hundred hunters rallied, their response thundering through the air.</p><p>「To eliminate the monsters and protect the people from all threats!」</p><p>「This is why we do not retreat. Three hundred twenty-five of us, including me, Shao Shen, the Commander of the 1st regiment of the Sichuan Province Public Security Forces, are here to defend the people!」</p><p>Shao Shen continued in a soothing tone.</p><p>「Now it's your turn to answer, Mr. Choi.」</p><p>Choi Min-Woo, observing the horde of monsters nearing, exclaimed.</p><p>"Damn it, there are so many of them."</p><p>「…!」</p><p>"That's what he probably would have said, then fought more fiercely than anyone else, and end up winning in the end."</p><p>That was always his way.</p><p>He never retreated from a challenge and never conceded defeat. Choi Min-Woo, having observed him closely for the longest time, understood this well.</p><p>That man, Jin Tae-Kyung, was a hero of this new era, and Choi Min-Woo knew he himself could not perform such feats. But...</p><p>"It's embarrassing, isn't it?"</p><p>「Excuse me?」</p><p>"Jin Tae-Kyung is technically my subordinate. In times like these, a superior should lead by example."</p><p>Choi Min-Woo's laughter was loud enough to surprise Shao Shen.</p><p>His heart felt as light as a dandelion fluff, and an unfamiliar yet potent energy surged within him, directed at the foes.</p><p>'Let's meet later, Jin Tae-Kyung.'</p><p>If I survive today, as soon as possible. If I perish, then as late as possible.</p><p>Either way, I'll see you again.</p><p>Shiiing!</p><p>His sword, now radiating a clearer, brighter aura, targeted the enemies.</p><p>The shouts of the three hundred valiant fighters and their fighting spirit shot through the air like arrows.</p><p>Aaaaaah!</p><p>The two Death Knights, astride skeletal horses leading the monstrous legion and decimating the People's Liberation Army, surveyed the meager human resistance.</p><p>- Aksar. Garosh.</p><p>Soon after, the dark tide swept over the white stones.</p><p>Though the outcome was predetermined, the fight was fiercer than any before, illuminated by a sword that never dimmed from start to finish.</p><p>\* \* \*</p><p>The two Death Knights knelt on one knee before the Black Knight, their gaze fixed on him.</p><p>- In battle.</p><p>- We have secured victory.</p><p>- Today’s glory.</p><p>- Is offered to our Lord.</p><p>They reported in clipped, emotionless tones. Despite their announcement of victory, the Black Knight merely nodded, his expression unchanged.</p><p>The humans had indeed succumbed quickly to his formidable legion, just as anticipated.</p><p>However, had everything unfolded as the Black Knight planned? Not exactly.</p><p>'Those humans.'</p><p>The Black Knight, having breached the city's defenses and forced the humans to retreat, now turned his horse around casually.</p><p>For some reason, at the familiar location from the previous day, he noticed something small.</p><p>'Human? No, not a human, but a child. And these are shoes.'</p><p>Memories and phrases came flooding back.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he realized it was indeed a child's shoe, overlooked in the mayhem.</p><p>Gazing at the mud-smeared shoe, a strange pang of familiarity tugged at his heart.</p><p>'Hmm? My chest hurts?'</p><p>What an odd sensation.</p><p>The Black Knight's body had been immune to pain since his creation. His master had forged him, endowing him with a powerful blessing that rendered him impervious to fatigue and pain.</p><p>Nevertheless, now was not the moment to dwell on such minor distractions.</p><p>- Lord.</p><p>- Is there a problem?</p><p>He couldn't explain why he did it.</p><p>The Black Knight slipped the shoe he held into a crevice in his armor and swiftly shifted the conversation.</p><p>- No. Rather, quite a few of the humans managed to escape.</p><p>- We apologize.</p><p>- It was our oversight.</p><p>- There must be a reason.</p><p>The Death Knights bowed deeply.</p><p>- The struggle of the humans.</p><p>- Was more fierce than expected.</p><p>- However.</p><p>- There was a small reward.</p><p>As though awaiting these words, the horde of monsters split, forming a clear path.</p><p>A troll cautiously stepped forward and placed what it had been carrying on its shoulders on the ground before withdrawing.</p><p>The Black Knight’s gaze sharpened as he looked at the 'small reward.'</p><p>- Here they are.</p><p>- They are humans.</p><p>His two faithful lieutenants replied in unison and continued.</p><p>- Please collect their souls yourself.</p><p>- Make them servants of our Lord.</p><p>- By doing so.</p><p>- Our Lord will become even stronger.</p><p>Indeed, these two humans harbored rich and alluring souls.</p><p>Once harvested, they could become formidable warriors, worthy of leading a legion.</p><p>But...</p><p>'Why?'</p><p>The Black Knight found himself hesitating.</p><p>It was clear what he needed to do — acquiring powerful subordinates would bolster the legion, a demonstration of his loyalty and commitment to the Monarch of the Undead.</p><p>Yet, he paused.</p><p>'What is making me hesitate?'</p><p>Typically, he would dismiss such unease immediately. But recently, the Black Knight had been grappling with many internal conflicts.</p><p>Perhaps this hesitation was a silent act of rebellion against himself.</p><p>- I will accept your gift.</p><p>Just as the Black Knight extended his hand to claim the souls of the two humans.</p><p>"I've thought it over."</p><p>A voice resonated from above.</p><p>Atop a hospital rooftop, half-demolished and smoldering, a figure stood silhouetted against the sunlight breaking through the dark clouds.</p><p>"10%... that's surprisingly high odds. Hmm. Definitely higher than my chances of getting a girlfriend."</p><p>The Black Knight's eyes narrowed, recognizing the aura he had detected the previous day.</p><p>At last, he encountered the man radiated immense heat.</p><p>- Who are you?</p><p>"Me?"</p><p>Swoosh. Thud.</p><p>In a flash, a young human descended from above, landing gracefully as a leaf might, pointing to himself with a smile.</p><p>"I'm a very lucky bastard."</p><p>In that instant, the Black Knight saw it clearly.</p><p>The human's finger turned to point towards his direction. Simultaneously, all expression drained from his face.</p><p>"And you are..."</p><p>A voice chilling enough to make even the dead shudder followed.</p><p>"An unlucky bastard."<br></p>
