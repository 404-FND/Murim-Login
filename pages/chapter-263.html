                        <p>"To be precise, the nemesis who killed your dearest friend."<br><br>Such a proclamation rendered me motionless.<br><br>I could sense a similar shock emanating from Jeok Cheon-Gang beside me.<br><br>'What did I just hear?'<br><br>The information was too jarring to digest immediately. This stranger's words scrambled my thoughts.<br><br>Could it be...<br><br>'Did he kill Hong Dao? This young man?'<br><br>Memories deeply etched in my mind surfaced and then faded away.<br><br>Hong Dao's labored final breaths, Jong Richu's mysterious disappearance during the martial arts tournament, and the four enigmatic words Hong Dao left behind.<br><br>'Jong Richu, Dark Heaven, Nameless, Buddha's Staff.'<br><br>What had I witnessed until now?<br><br>Where had the path twisted?<br><br>Desperately trying to assemble the pieces, I was interrupted by the grave words from Jeok Cheon-Gang.<br><br>"You... you were the one to kill Hong Dao?"<br><br>His voice quivered, laden with a mix of shock, rage, and disbelief.<br><br>In response, the young man offered a faint smile, nodding.<br><br>"Yes. It was easier than I thought. When I threatened to detonate the Heaven-Shaking Thunder in the audience, he followed willingly."<br><br>"The Heaven-Shaking Thunder? You planted explosives?"<br><br>"That? Merely a deception."<br><br>"...What?"<br><br>"People lie because there exist those naive enough to believe."<br><br>Blood oozed from Jeok Cheon-Gang's clenched fist.<br><br>"He wasn't deceived; he chose to believe. It was in Hong Dao's nature."<br><br>"He chose to believe? It's plausible. As the leader of Shaolin, perhaps he wished to prevent any potential harm."<br><br>"Bastard!"<br><br>"Please, don't be overly harsh. I hadn't intended for such a hasty approach. However, complications arose. Primarily, due to—..." Abruptly, his attention shifted to me.<br><br>"Jin Tae-Kyung, the Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi. You're not without blame."<br><br>Locking eyes with him sent a shiver down my spine.<br><br>Was it the animosity I felt or the palpable gap in our abilities?<br><br>'Maybe it's both.'<br><br>Resisting the urge to falter, I met his gaze fiercely.<br><br>"What the hell are you talking about?"<br><br>"Your unanticipated interference in the martial arts contest forced me to hasten my strategy by a day. The biggest wildcard was the Ever-Victorious Sword, Jong Richu."<br><br>"..."<br><br>It was undeniably clear now: Jong Richu wasn't the mastermind, nor was he an accomplice.<br><br>"Well, in the end, everything has been neatly tied."<br><br>The man smirked, extending his hand in expectation. <br><br>Hansu, recognizing the gesture, quickly proffered an item.<br><br>"The divine artifact of Shaolin, the Green Jade Ruyi."<br><br>"So, this is it..."<br><br>Elegant fingers delicately traced the luminous Green Jade Ruyi.<br><br>However, the very next moment, the young man’s eyes bore into Hansu’s, the latter’s withered hand still gripping the relic.<br><br>"You can let go now."<br><br>Hansu gulped before answering.<br><br>"Blood Lord, might I make a request?"<br><br>"A request, you say? Speak your mind. You've done a great job, so I should certainly hear you out."<br><br>The scene before me was surreal.<br><br>An elderly man deferring to a youth, a potential grandson in age.<br><br>Even more so, when that elder was the architect of Shaolin's massacre.<br><br>'What exactly is his identity?' Two probable answers surfaced: either he's of immense significance within Dark Heaven or his youth belies his true age. Perhaps, both theories held merit.<br><br>Nevertheless, as the Blood Lord's affirmative response reached Hansu's ears, hope illuminated his features.<br><br>"Truly?"<br><br>The Blood Lord clicked his tongue.<br><br>"Have I misled you before? Given your impeccable execution, a reward is only just. However, I'm curious. What has rendered our esteemed elder so hesitant?"<br><br>"My request is simple."<br><br>"Yet beyond your capabilities?"<br><br>"...Regrettably, yes."<br><br>"Aah, I think I can surmise your wish."<br><br>The Blood Lord gestured towards Jeok Cheon-Gang and me.<br><br>"Eradicate those two, correct?"<br><br>With a fervent gleam in his eyes, Hansu confirmed with a nod, eliciting a chuckle from the Blood Lord.<br><br>"Well, that's unexpected. It seems you two had a stronger bond than I thought."<br><br>"We’ve journeyed together for over half our lifetimes. This feels like the rightful closure."<br><br>"Brotherhood... Well, that's admirable."<br><br>"I implore you. Make their end as gruesome as possible. I pledge my aid as well."<br><br>"That's all you want? The righteous ones will soon descend upon us, complicating matters. A swift conclusion might demand some exertion on your part."<br><br>"So be it."<br><br>"The Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi is yours to confront, while I’ll engage the Fire King. By sunset, our task should be complete, yes?"<br><br>"I get the young one? Hahaha! Sounds good!"<br><br>The sheer audacity of their conversation, discussing mine and Jeok Cheon-Gang's fates as if they were trifling playthings, was both astounding and bone-chilling.<br><br>'He's serious about that statement.'<br><br>By sunset. He seemed assured he could finish Jeok Cheon-Gang in the time one might take to enjoy a brief respite.<br><br>Jeok Cheon-Gang's stiffened expression indicated these weren't mere hollow threats.<br><br>\- If the tide turns against you, retreat.<br><br>I subtly nodded at the faint whisper that reached my ears.<br><br>A tumultuous clash already raged above, so expecting help from Shaolin was unlikely.<br><br>Should I retreat, Jeok Cheon-Gang would bear the brunt of two transcendent martial masters.<br><br>'To stay and fight here is the optimal choice.'<br><br>I know Jeok Cheon-Gang recognizes this. Yet his suggestion... is a testament to his concealed warmth and protective nature.<br><br>'This feels precariously dire.'<br><br>Licking my parched lips, I tightly grasped the White Flames. Hansu chuckled at my appearance.<br><br>"Pitiful fool. How will that change anything? Your achievements are commendable, but with that alone, you'll never even scratch me in multiple lifetimes."<br><br>"Screw you."<br><br>In defiance, I spat on the ground.<br><br>"After a few hours here, if I rest and wake up, won't you be dead by my hand?"<br><br>"What nonsense are you spewing?"<br><br>"If you don't believe me, test me."<br><br>"How dare this brat!"<br><br>The frustration was palpable. Were it not for this ongoing battle, if signing off meant halting time rather than merely decelerating it, I'd possess endless opportunities to circumvent this crisis.<br><br>But these thoughts were merely whimsical fantasies.<br><br>Now was the time to face reality, not fantasies.<br><br>"Freeze him alive."<br><br>Thunk. Thunk. Crunch.<br><br>Now I grasped why the old man earned his moniker, the Yin Ghost.<br><br>With every step he took, the ground froze, and frost settled on tree branches.<br><br>"Freezing Yin Energy...I see. However..."<br><br>Jeok Cheon-Gang positioned himself protectively before me.<br><br>"Don't you dare lay a finger on this old man's disciple."<br><br>Hwaaaah!<br><br>If Hansu's Freezing Yin Energy resembled an iceberg, then Jeok Cheon-Gang's Scorching Yang Energy mirrored the blazing sun.<br><br>If we assumed the combat prowess of the now-vanquished Yeomho and Hansu were matched, Jeok Cheon-Gang would naturally hold the upper hand.<br><br>Nonetheless, Hansu appeared nonchalant, undoubtedly emboldened by the formidable presence at his back.<br><br>"It's time for the Blood Lord to intervene."<br><br>"Ah, indeed. Let the dance begin."<br><br>The Blood Lord, cradling the Green Jade Ruyi, moved. Or rather, he seemed to simply disappear.<br><br>And then, in the next heartbeat.<br><br>Swoosh! Thud!<br><br>A chilling sound reverberated as a decapitated head rolled to a stop before me.<br><br>Well-groomed white hair, a refined demeanor, and on his lips, the remnants of a confident smirk.<br><br>"......!"<br><br>"......!"<br><br>Both Jeok Cheon-Gang and I stared, our eyes widening in disbelief.<br><br>The Yin Ghost Hansu, a feared Demon Head and a transcendent expert, was decapitated in but a fleeting moment.<br><br>While the weight of this realization held us, the Blood Lord, the very architect of the act, seemed wholly undisturbed.<br><br>"Worthless old dog. This is why you shouldn't place trust in those without proper lineage."<br><br>He remarked with a trace of disdain, effortlessly toppling Hansu's headless form.<br><br>Splash. Like a felled ancient tree, the gushing blood from Hansu's torso drenched the ground.<br><br>"A tool's value lies in its user's skill. To think he dared..."<br><br>Thud! Thud! Crunch!<br><br>Each stomp he took resonated with weight, the ground yielding beneath his Qi-enhanced boots, grinding flesh and shattering bone.<br><br>The Blood Lord, after repeatedly trampling on the lifeless Hansu, tossed back his hanging hair.<br><br>"Some never grasp their insignificance, ever blind to their boundaries. Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi, wouldn’t you concur?"<br><br>...Me?<br><br>How should I respond? Gathering my thoughts, I spoke candidly.<br><br>"No. To me, you appear nothing more than a deranged lunatic."<br><br>For a split second, the Blood Lord looked genuinely taken aback, but then his expression softened into a smirk.<br><br>"This youngster has spirit."<br><br>"You seem like a youth who's lost his zest early on."<br><br>"It's amusing you perceive me as youthful. I've seen more years than you'd expect."<br><br>"How many, exactly?"<br><br>"Enough that I’ve experienced life at least twice as long as you."<br><br>I assessed him critically.<br><br>Matching my height and possessing a proportionate build.<br><br>His visage, at best, seemed that of someone in his early to mid-twenties.<br><br>Such agelessness went beyond mere 'youthful appearance'. Yet, isn't Murim the place where anything can happen?<br><br>"Ah, are you taken aback that I’ve lived longer than you anticipated?"<br><br>I shook my head.<br><br>"No. If your words hold truth, then it seems you've squandered a good portion of those years."<br><br>"Hahaha!"<br><br>The Blood Lord's laughter echoed, rich and full of genuine mirth.<br><br>Everything about him – from his posture to his tone – was not merely relaxed; it bordered on audacity. It only heightened the palpable aura of danger that surrounded him.<br><br>Even in the throes of his amusement, he showed no openings.<br><br>Jeok Cheon-Gang, eyes like coals of fire, broke the silence.<br><br>"You'll regret this."<br><br>"Regret?"<br><br>Stopping mid-chuckle, the Blood Lord's gaze grew intense.<br><br>"Why would I regret anything?"<br><br>"If you wanted a decisive finish, you shouldn't have killed the Yin Ghost."<br><br>"He was just a rusted blade. Once its use is spent, disposal is natural."<br><br>"And in your eyes, if a transcendence master is just a rusted blade... what does this old man signify?"<br><br>Pausing for a moment, the Blood Lord said with a mock inquisitiveness.<br><br>"Ah, the Fire King. You are a blade of legend. Had the Great Faction War lingered but another year, we might have heralded not Three, but Four Saints."<br><br>"I still draw breath."<br><br>"You're certainly skilled enough to be deemed a legendary sword."<br><br>"What if that legendary sword pierces your heart?"<br><br>"Well... from my perspective, I'm rather resilient. I doubt it'd even draw a drop of blood."<br><br>"When Hong Dao died, this old man swore to the heavens."<br><br>Jeok Cheon-Gang's stare pierced the now-smiling Blood Lord.<br><br>"Be it beast or demon responsible, they would know vengeance."<br><br>"How touching, truly. But..."<br><br>Laughter now silenced, the Blood Lord's fingers traced the hilt of his blade.<br><br>"I suspect today might herald the fall of the Scorching Clan."<br><br>Eyes unwavering from the Blood Lord, Jeok Cheon-Gang sought my opinion.<br><br>"What do you think of his words?"<br><br>"I think he needs a muzzle for his mouth. He's been spewing crap since earlier."<br><br>The smirk vanished from the Blood Lord's face.<br><br>"... You really are amusing."<br><br>Thud. Taking a step towards Jeok Cheon-Gang and me, he suddenly spoke.<br><br>"By the way, how long does that little rat over there intend to hide?"<br><br>Out of the blue, from a distant bush, a figure emerged, scratching the back of his head.<br><br>"Savior. I'm sorry. I've never been this scared in my life..."<br><br>It was the first time I was so relieved to see Cheong Pung.</p>
