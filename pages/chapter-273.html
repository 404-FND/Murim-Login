                        <p>“Hello!”<br><br>"Hello!”<br><br>I felt like the boss of an old crime family; every new guild member I passed dropped into a bow of respect.<br><br>The rookies, fresh from their training, greeted me with the exuberance of new recruits eager to make their mark. Their reverence was understandable, given the gap in our experience.<br><br>'This field certainly places a strong emphasis on seniority.'<br><br>But among these rookies were Hunters, weathered and matured by life, who, despite their age, were new to the craft.<br><br>“It's an honor to meet you!”<br><br>A burly newcomer, with lines of age etching his face, bent deeply at the waist, admiration gleaming in his eyes.<br><br>The sunlight caught the bald spot atop his head, and I found that more distracting than the intensity of his gaze.<br><br>“Yes. Keep up the good work…”<br><br>“Thank you!”<br><br>“Thank you!”<br><br>A chorus of gratitude echoed back, and I couldn't help but smirk.<br><br>I wasn’t talking to all of you. You bastards.<br><br>I internally roll my eyes at the newbies, but my gaze then stops on a young man.<br><br>'He seems promising.'<br><br>He stands out among the newcomers.<br><br>Every gesture of his was measured, reminiscent of a martial artist. He exuded a unique aura.<br><br>As if sensing my scrutiny, he met my gaze, a hint of mischief playing on his lips.<br><br>"Hello, sir."<br><br>His demeanor set him apart; he was relaxed, neither as tense as the rest nor excessively ingratiating.<br><br>In my years, I've come across two such types:<br><br>The arrogant ones with nothing to show for it, and those whose self-assurance was rooted in genuine skill.<br><br>He was unmistakably the latter.<br><br>“May I ask your name?”<br><br>“My name is Kim Jin-Soo. I graduated top of my class in the B-rank training program. I was also the first to destroy the core of the golem during the recent raid.”<br><br>"Is that so?”<br><br>"Yes. It was my first time dealing with an A-rank gate, but it wasn't as difficult as I thought.”<br><br>He's an interesting guy.<br><br>He is proud without being arrogant; the type who will always ensure he gets what's due to him wherever he goes.<br><br>When I looked at him intently, Kim Jin-Soo smiled cheerfully.<br><br>“You can speak informally if you’d like, sir.”<br><br>“I'll consider it when I feel more comfortable. I'd appreciate if everyone would skip the grand greetings though.”<br><br>“Yes sir!”<br><br>“I’ll keep that in mind, sir!”<br><br>They clearly don’t listen.<br><br>Amidst the loud clamor, the office door at the end of the corridor slid open.<br><br>A crisp white shirt with perfectly ironed black slacks. Only one Hunter in our guild dresses like that for work.<br><br>“You’re all lively this morning.”<br><br>“A bit too lively, actually.”<br><br>Team Leader Choi, coffee cup in hand, gestured toward his office.<br><br>“Join me for coffee?”<br><br>His office was both spacious and elegantly adorned. Whether by choice or by design, the luxury furnishings suggested a refined taste. An ornate silver nameplate took pride of place on his desk.<br><br>\[Team Leader Choi Min-Woo\]<br><br>'Even the nameplate looks expensive.'<br><br>Considering the cost of relocating the guild house and recruiting new members, it seems the rumor that Won Myung-Hoon, as the guild leader of the famous Star Guild, had secured an astronomical sum in agreement fees is true.<br><br>As I was admiring the nameplate, a cup filled with black coffee was suddenly offered to me.<br><br>Team Leader Choi, noticing where I was looking, asked,<br><br>“Want me to get one made for you? A nameplate.”<br><br>“It’s alright. I don’t even have a formal position, so why bother?”<br><br>“We can create a position for you. General Manager. Head of Department. Just name it.”<br><br>“Anything?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Then, maybe something modest, like Guild Leader...That's just a joke. Honestly, if I were the Guild Leader, we'd be doomed.”<br><br>Besides, if I tried any title, it’d probably end up being something ridiculous like "Face Lady" or "Pants Boss". \[Note: The Korean term for "Face Lady" is slang for a woman who is only recognized for her appearance. Similarly, the term for "Pants Boss" is slang for someone who appears in charge but lacks actual authority or influence.\]<br><br>I took the coffee cup and sat on the sofa. On the glass table, there were more than two dozen newspapers stacked.<br><br>From major domestic daily newspapers to foreign newspapers filled with unrecognizable characters. Just looking at them felt overwhelming.<br><br>“You don’t possibly read all of these, do you?”<br><br>“I scan through them to gauge international trends and gather industry information. It's nothing. Even if you only read five languages, you can make sense of most of them.”<br><br>That’s quite significant. Five languages? What kind of life has this man led? I gawked and glanced at one of the open newspapers.<br><br>My eyes were immediately drawn to a striking photo of a man in his prime, paired with a bold headline:<br><br>\- In Memory of Hunter Jeong Hyeon-Woo (with photo attached) - Recent mishaps remind us that even A-rank Hunters are not immune to the perils of the gates. Myeongdong Guild mourns the sudden loss...<br><br>Another accident must have happened.<br><br>'Myeongdong Guild? That's Ji-Hwang's guild.'<br><br>I was about to delve deeper when Team Leader Choi, taking a measured sip from his coffee, interrupted my thoughts.<br><br>“Peace Guild will continue to grow. We've already recruited twenty B-rank Hunters and thirty C-rank or lower. At this rate, our growth in the saturated domestic market is unprecedented.”<br><br>Indeed, as he said, Peace Guild's growth was meteoric.<br><br>Only about four months have passed since the guild was established. Yet, if this momentum continued, it would soon rival the stature of medium-tier guilds.<br><br>'In terms of sheer numbers, we might still trail behind some mid-tier guilds. However, it's not a matter of inability, but simply choice.'<br><br>Evidence of our burgeoning reputation was clear when the guild's website crashed under a surge of traffic.<br><br>There were hundreds of recruitment inquiries daily.<br><br>"I must admit, my contributions played a substantial part in that success."<br><br>"That's true."<br><br>Team Leader Choi responded smoothly.<br><br>"It might be true, but there won’t be any bonus."<br><br>"…You're quick to catch on."<br><br>I tried to tease him slightly, but it didn’t faze him at all.<br><br>Team Leader Choi paused, his smirk a little more mischievous,<br><br>"However, there might be room for negotiation if you'd grant me a small favor."<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>"I'd like you to look after the new guild members for a while."<br><br>"…The newbies?"<br><br>"Yes. We've selected them carefully, and while they have talent, they are still very inexperienced."<br><br>"That's expected. They're brand new."<br><br>I nodded in understanding. Field experience held a different weight.<br><br>An elite Hunter straight out of the academy doesn't necessarily overshadow a seasoned, albeit lower-tiered, Hunter.<br><br>"But why me... what about the others?"<br><br>"I already spoke with Butler Kim and Miss Song this morning. I asked them to take turns training."<br><br>"What did they say?"<br><br>"They were eager. Not a hint of reluctance."<br><br>"...What about Hyuk-Jun?"<br><br>“I haven't mentioned it yet, but he missed his reporting time and hasn't called in to explain."<br><br>Team Leader Choi cast a fleeting look at the clock before continuing.<br><br>“His absence is troubling. In any case, the new guild members are hoping to be mentored by you, Jin Tae-Kyung. Most of them applied to our guild largely because of you.”<br><br>"Well, I appreciate the flattery.”<br><br>I scratched the back of my head.<br><br>In the present martial realm, Dark Heaven has made its presence known while Jeok Cheon-Gang lies incapacitated.<br><br>Even if I spend thirty days in the modern world, in the martial realm only about three hours would pass. Although I had some leeway in terms of time, mentoring the rookies wasn’t an especially advantageous choice given the potential A-rank gates to tackle.<br><br>Moments with my family seemed a far better use of time.<br><br>"Please exclude me. From the guild’s perspective, wouldn’t it be more efficient for me to break one more A-rank gate than to teach the newcomers?"<br><br>"Efficient..."<br><br>"Yes, efficient."<br><br>"Well, in that case, there’s nothing I can do."<br><br>His lips twitched, mischief in his eyes.<br><br>"We entrust our new guild members to you.”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>"All A-rank gates are fully booked. There’s no chance for at least the next week.”<br><br>"Don’t lie! You swindler!”<br><br>"If you really don’t believe me, see for yourself.”<br><br>I snatched the paper Team Leader Choi extended. It was densely written with the reservation status of A-rank gates all over the country.<br><br>Damn, it’s true.<br><br>"I'll double your compensation this month – for both raiding and guiding the novices. Or you could simply enjoy a quiet time at home.”<br><br>The corners of Team Leader Choi’s mouth curled up in a teasing manner.<br><br>Before I could blurt out my refusal, a system notification sounded.<br><br>Ding!<br><br>\- Quest \[An Offer You Can't Refuse\] has been generated! \[Note: the direct translation of the quest title is "I will not! It was too much money to say that."\]<br><br>\- Would you like to accept the quest? Y / N<br><br>“What will it be?”<br><br>We stared at each other, not saying a word.<br><br>“I'll take that as a yes and get the newbies prepared. We have a few B-rank gates lined up.”<br><br>Ding!<br><br>\- You have implicitly agreed!<br><br>\- Quest accepted!<br><br>Damn it.<br><br>\*\*\*<br><br>Growl!<br><br>A chorus of guttural growls echoed in the dense woods. The cacophony of monsters' breaths grew deafening, their looming presence encircling a group of twenty anxious Hunters.<br><br>Grips tightened on weapons, knuckles blanching from the pressure.<br><br>From my vantage point on a sturdy tree branch, I observed the pandemonium below, my face a mask of indifference.<br><br>Yet, the storm in my mind brewed a debate of utmost importance.<br><br>'What should I have for dinner?'<br><br>Should I have ribs or perhaps boiled duck, which I haven’t had in a while?<br><br>Both options are too tempting to pass up...<br><br>“Hold them back!”<br><br>"What's the dealer doing? Attack!”<br><br>Screams of terror disrupted my thoughts, and I glanced down to see utter chaos.<br><br>A wave of about ten Lycanthropes lunged, battering the formation.<br><br>The tankers, faces paling, began to falter.<br><br>'Of course, they're getting pushed back. They're trying to face the monsters with sheer strength.'<br><br>But it wasn't solely the tankers' fault. The dealers, overwhelmed, weren't doing their part.<br><br>If the appropriate counter-attacks had been deployed at the right time, this situation could have been avoided.<br><br>I warned them several times before the raid started, but it’s the same every time.<br><br>'That shield wall will be breached soon.'<br><br>My prediction proved true in moments, as the barrier gave way amidst a crescendo of screams.<br><br>The most agile Lycanthrope, marked by its distinctive howl, leaped forward.<br><br>Its predatory gaze fixed on the healers behind the now broken defense.<br><br>ROAR!<br><br>HOWL!<br><br>To me, it just sounded like a dog barking, but the rookie Hunters, who were only on their second raid, were clearly terrified.<br><br>“ARGHHH!”<br><br>“Aaaargh!”<br><br>A shrill scream, a blend of fear and agony from both mage and healer, pierced the dusky silence of the forest.<br><br>The battle was already noisy enough, but that scream will likely attract twenty more.<br><br>I mentally tagged the duo responsible for the outburst.<br><br>From now on, their nicknames will be 'The Whistling Men'.<br><br>“Sunbae! Jin Tae-Kyung sunbae!” \[Note: Sunbae is the Korean term for "senior", analogous to "senpai" in Japanese.\]<br><br>“Help us! Sunbae!”<br><br>Frantic faces turned upward, their eyes wide with terror, seeking me out.<br><br>Their initial defense had been shattered, and now, they huddled against a solitary, towering boulder, their last refuge.<br><br>The Lycanthropes, sensing imminent victory, closed in, almost mockingly coordinated.<br><br>'How come these monsters form better formations than us?'<br><br>Yawning slightly, I called out,<br><br>“I told you, didn't I? If I help, you won't improve.”<br><br>“I don't care about improving!”<br><br>“Well I care. You know what? If you get used to receiving help, you'll even soil yourself during raids out of habit.”<br><br>“We don't want to die like this!”<br><br>“Well... who does?”<br><br>“Please, help us!”<br><br>“Don't give up; keep fighting. Go, team!”<br><br>“Save us!”<br><br>"By the way, for tonight's dinner, should I go for ribs or boiled duck?"<br><br>“Hey, you bastard!”<br><br>It was the bald rookie from earlier, his scalp gleaming in the dim light.<br><br>The reverence that once graced his gaze had morphed into pure wrath.<br><br>“Come down here, you brat!”<br><br>Thud!<br><br>Out of the blue, a tanker catapulted, colliding with the irate rookie, sending him sprawling.<br><br>With the momentum swinging unmistakably towards the monsters, I pondered intervening. But before I could act, an abrupt commotion below caught my attention.<br><br>Slush!<br><br>Growwwwl...<br><br>A guttural growl echoed. In a swift blur, one of the Lycanthropes clutched its slashed throat, crimson spilling forth, before keeling over.<br><br>With a confident stride and a sharp swing of his weapon, the young man landed a devastating blow, immediately calling out,<br><br>"Formation Three!"<br><br>His commanding voice acted like a beacon, pulling the scattered Hunters back to focus.<br><br>In moments, a band of twenty Hunters organized into a formidable formation, inching forward in unity.<br><br>Leading the charge was none other than Kim Jin-Soo.<br><br>"Push forward! Archers, prepare your skills!"<br><br>This guy is pretty useful, huh?<br><br>Without hesitation, I descended from my perch, spear in hand, cleaving through the oncoming horde of Lycanthropes attracted by the clash.<br><br>Shrieeeek!<br><br>"Well done."<br><br>"Thank you, sunbae!"<br><br>Gratitude gleamed in Kim Jin-Soo's eyes as he inclined his head. Behind him, three Hunters lay subdued.<br><br>Among them were the Whistling Men and the balding rookie.<br><br>In a playful show of authority, I had the balding Hunter doing push-ups.<br><br>Might as well preserve what's left of his dignity...<br><br>"Learn from today, and you'll do better next time."<br><br>"Yes. We won't let you down."<br><br>"Then, Jin-Soo, you should rest too. We have another raid in two hours anyway."<br><br>Team Leader Choi really went all out, scheduling three raids in a day.<br><br>As I mulled over the packed day ahead, a vibrating alert interrupted my thoughts.<br><br>\[Luxury Brand-Name Fanatic\] \[Note: the direct translation here is "Brand-Name Fanatic" or "Luxury Goods Addict". This is the name that the MC used for Team Leader Choi's saved contact.\]<br><br>Did he develop telepathy or something?<br><br>Perplexed, I answered swiftly, only to hear the urgency in Team Leader Choi's voice.<br><br>\- Tae-Kyung, come to Ilsan Hospital right now!<br><br>Hospital?</p>
