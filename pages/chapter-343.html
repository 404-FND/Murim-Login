                        <p>Whoooosh.<br><br>"The wind's really howling. Fuck."<br><br>I shivered as the biting cold sliced through my leather clothes. So much for immunity to hot and cold - it felt more like heightened sensitivity.<br><br>"Achoo!"<br><br>At the unexpected sound, I turned to see Hyuk Mu-Jin clutching his frost-nipped nose.<br><br>Our gazes locked, and he squinted suspiciously.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"..."<br><br>"What are you looking at?"<br><br>"No, I was just amazed by the sound of your sneeze..."<br><br>"Seriously, you find the weirdest things amazing. Instead of that, you could be digging up another herb."<br><br>"...Alright, my bad."<br><br>I diverted my eyes, scanning the vicinity for herbs.<br><br>Five days into our enslavement in the Freezing Tundra, the dynamics of our relationship had dramatically shifted.<br><br>"Ahhh, what are you doing? There's one over there! There!"<br><br>"Oh, right."<br><br>"Pay attention!"<br><br>I can't even smack him for that.<br><br>If Hyuk Mu-Jin's mother had taught him not to jump off bridges even if everyone else was doing it, maybe he would have reconsidered following me to the Freezing Tundra and facing this unparalleled hardship.<br><br>Considering that he used to only grumble a bit when caught in all sorts of predicaments, his fiery gaze when caught in this one spoke volumes.<br><br>"I'll go dig herbs over that hill. Don't stop, keep going. I'll check in from time to time."<br><br>"...Got it."<br><br>Reminding myself to be patient and benevolent, I carefully brushed aside the snow, harvesting a herb.<br><br>Depositing it into the sack supplied by the Divine Doctor — our nefarious employer — a system alert chimed.<br><br>Ding.<br><br>\- You have gathered \[Hard Ice Herb\].<br><br>\- Quantity in inventory \[100 / 100\].<br><br>\- You have completed the gathering of \[Hard Ice Herb\]!<br><br>"Phew. Finally finished another one."<br><br>Seeing a glimmer of the end brings a fleeting sense of relief.<br><br>While I examined the quest window for the count of remaining items, Goong Gi-Bang, shivering, made his way over.<br><br>"How much more do we need?"<br><br>"About two hundred roots. We might finish today if we're lucky."<br><br>"Still two hundred roots left?"<br><br>"It's only two hundred roots. Just a bit more effort."<br><br>"No. Two hundred roots is too much. By that time, I'll be a frozen corpse buried somewhere in this snow."<br><br>"..."<br><br>Damn it.<br><br>Quivering, Goong Gi-Bang produced a fire starter and ignited it.<br><br>He huddled near the weak flame, whispering wistfully.<br><br>"I miss Master. I miss sitting in the alley in front of the warm inn, begging..."<br><br>Is he the little match girl?<br><br>His sentiment left me in disbelief.<br><br>"But you were a beggar."<br><br>"At least I was a warm beggar. Better than a cold beggar by a hundred times."<br><br>"...That's true."<br><br>"I want to go back to those times. A lazy noon, the bright sunlight. The delicious-looking yellow dog..."<br><br>Why the fixation on the yellow dog?<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang's eyes began to close slowly, as though he might succumb to sleep.<br><br>Has this bastard lost his mind out in the snow...?<br><br>"Hey, hey!"<br><br>I quickly channeled Scorching Yang Qi into him, desperate for him to cling to consciousness.<br><br>Please wake up...<br><br>"It's warm...and comfortable..."<br><br>"Wake up, you idiot!"<br><br>Slap! Slap!<br><br>Despite my efforts to rouse him with slaps, his eyes remained shut.<br><br>Continuing to infuse Scorching Yang Qi, I called out for help.<br><br>"Is there anyone there? Someone come quickly!"<br><br>The urgency in my voice carried across the expanse, swiftly bringing help to our side.<br><br>"Savior! Savior!"<br><br>"Nice, Cheong Pung! Quickly, take him out..."<br><br>Cheong Pung, who dashed over with the speed of the wind, greeted me with a beaming smile, holding out his hands.<br><br>"Savior, look at this! It's the first snowman I've ever made!"<br><br>"Cheong Pung, now is not the time!"<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>Upon verifying the contents of the sack, the Divine Doctor gave a nod of approval.<br><br>"This should be sufficient."<br><br>Ding.<br><br>\- You have successfully completed the linked quest, \[Herb Slave of the Freezing Tundra\]!<br><br>\- You have earned the achievement, \[Simmani Returns from Hell Alive\]!<br><br>\- You have earned 10 bonus points for earning this achievement!<br><br>Looking at the ridiculous title of the achievement, I didn't even have the energy to get angry.<br><br>The Divine Doctor's gaze, observing our exhausted faces, suddenly stopped on one person.<br><br>"Why does Young Master Cheong Pung look so disheartened?"<br><br>That's because I destroyed Cheong Pung's first-ever snowman with my Divine Palm of Fire.<br><br>Still glaring at the sullen Cheong Pung as if I would kill him, I asked the Divine Doctor.<br><br>"Does this mean we're all prepared now?"<br><br>"Yes. With this amount, we can be prepared for whatever may happen later."<br><br>"Prepared, you say?"<br><br>The Divine Doctor nodded solemnly.<br><br>"One can never be too sure what will happen."<br><br>I then realized something. The Divine Doctor had never once been 'certain' about anything.<br><br>He only saw possibilities and promised to do his best.<br><br>'It's not over until it's over.'<br><br>A mantra I often repeated during dire moments now seemed to taunt me.<br><br>With no other recourse, I could only offer one plea.<br><br>"Please, do your best."<br><br>"This old man will do everything he can. I promise."<br><br>Mun-Kyung, by the Divine Doctor's side, assured me with an eager tone.<br><br>"I will also do my best to assist Master."<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>"It's only my duty as a student."<br><br>"When will the formal treatment begin?"<br><br>With a contemplative pause, the Divine Doctor responded.<br><br>"Probably after seven nights and days. By then, Mun-Kyung and I will have prepared the twenty-four types of herbs you've brought, consolidating and refining them for use in the Great Revival Technique."<br><br>"Is that everything?"<br><br>"It's only a part. Fortunately, we already have the other ingredients required for the Great Revival Technique, which has saved us time."<br><br>"What exactly is the Great Revival Technique?"<br><br>The Divine Doctor answered while stroking his pure white beard.<br><br>"As I've mentioned before, my Master was once a martial artist himself. He mainly offered medical help to the common people but also had a deep understanding of how to manage Qi."<br><br>This revelation connected the dots for me.<br><br>Hyuk Mu-Jin, astounded, contributed.<br><br>"A martial artist! So the Great Revival Technique was created to treat martial artists."<br><br>"Yes. The Ancient Master of Illusions was one of them. Thanks to the Great Revival Technique, he recovered from Qi Deviation and left us the Qi Entrance Array before departing."<br><br>To martial artists, Qi Deviation is akin to a death sentence. It causes a backlash of power, entangling Qi and blood, damaging meridians and the dantian.<br><br>It's as if a small bomb explodes inside of a person.<br><br>'To think it cured Qi Deviation.'<br><br>If the Divine Doctor considered it serious, the Ancient Master of Illusions must have been nearly a walking corpse at that time.<br><br>Such accounts underscore the Great Revival Technique's potential efficacy.<br><br>'This bodes well for Grandfather...'<br><br>I dismissed the ensuing thought.<br><br>I have no room for doubt or worry at present.<br><br>"Please take care of him."<br><br>"Nobody should approach the patient until the Great Revival Technique is ready. Understood?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Once the preparation for the Great Revival Technique is complete, we will have a clearer understanding of the patient's condition, so please wait until then."<br><br>"I'll keep that in mind."<br><br>"Remember, after seven days and nights."<br><br>But Divine Doctor's words were not heeded.<br><br>Merely three days later, his return alongside Mun-Kyung bore an ominous air, their expressions laden with gravity.<br><br>"…What happened?"<br><br>Mun-Kyung broke the tense silence, revealing a grim discovery.<br><br>"Phantom Poison."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"There's an unidentified poison inside the patient's body. That's the real reason he is asleep."<br><br>"Wait, just a minute."<br><br>My mind was in chaos.<br><br>This unexpected mention of Phantom Poison left me unsettled. My gaze shifted to the Divine Doctor.<br><br>"What does this mean?"<br><br>"Just as you heard."<br><br>The Divine Doctor appeared notably more worn than before, his fatigue evident.<br><br>"While preparing the Great Revival Technique and observing the patient's condition, we found something odd. The Scorching Yang Qi, which should have been growing stronger, was actually diminishing." \[Note: Just a reminder, based on the Divine Doctor's previous description, the prediagnosis is that the Fire King's body is overflowing with Scorching Yang Qi due to the Ghostly Dance of the Fire God. So that's why he said that the Scorching Yang Qi should have been growing stronger.\]<br><br>"Isn't that a good thing? What's with the sudden talk about poison, what does it mean..."<br><br>"How could the Scorching Yang Qi diminish on its own without even performing the Great Revival Technique?"<br><br>"That is…"<br><br>"Didn't you feel anything strange?"<br><br>A realization dawned on me in that instant.<br><br>Throughout our journey from Hanam to Sichuan, I diligently circulated Jeok Cheon-Gang's energies with my own Qi, yet, despite my efforts, his Scorching Yang Qi persistently declined.<br><br>'I thought he was just weakening.'<br><br>Observing my grave demeanor, the Divine Doctor let out a deep sigh.<br><br>"When one type of energy dominates, the opposite energy decreases. But the patient was different. The Yin energy remained the same, but the Scorching Yang Qi was slightly reducing."<br><br>"Is that… because of the poison?"<br><br>"Though I don't know how it happened, an untouchable Phantom Poison was hidden in the patient's body. By chance or misfortune, the runaway Scorching Yang Qi enveloped the poison, preventing it from spreading and dissolving the body into a puddle of blood."<br><br>"…!"<br><br>I was at a loss for when or how the Phantom Poison infiltrated Jeok Cheon-Gang's body.<br><br>Yet, it was evident that the Scorching Yang Qi was serving as a barricade, hindering the poison's proliferation.<br><br>"So, is it impossible to treat with the Great Revival Technique?"<br><br>"The Great Revival Technique can regulate energy and untangle knotted Qi and blood, but it's insufficient for detoxifying such Phantom Poison. If we proceed with the Great Revival Technique now… the Scorching Yang Qi might calm down, but we'll have no way to stop the poison."<br><br>I urgently shouted.<br><br>"We'll find an antidote! Wouldn't the Tang Family of Sichuan have something?"<br><br>"…Young Master Jin."<br><br>The Divine Doctor said with a grim face, shaking his head.<br><br>"It's well known that the Tang Family of Sichuan is unparalleled in handling poisons, but this poison…"<br><br>His words trailed off, leaving a heavy silence that weighed on my heart.<br><br>'Even the Tang Family of Sichuan isn't enough?'<br><br>Damn it. This is a fucked situation.<br><br>It's like two ferocious wolves inside Jeok Cheon-Gang's body are keeping each other in check.<br><br>If one disappears, the other will run wild.<br><br>And now, with no clear path to detoxification…<br><br>'Fucking shitty situation...!'<br><br>As my fist clenched tighter, drawing blood, a fiery sensation gripped my throat, as though I were ingesting flames.<br><br>Struggling to restrain a torrent of expletives, another voice pierced the tense atmosphere.<br><br>"There is a way."<br><br>Opening my eyes, I saw Mun-Kyung with a more serious expression than I had ever seen him.<br><br>"Let's go to the Tang Family of Sichuan."<br><br>The Divine Doctor gazed at his pupil with a mix of solemnity and resignation.<br><br>"Mun-Kyung, as you know, this Phantom Poison…"<br><br>"I know, Master. You've said that the Tang Family's poison skills are focused on killing, and they lack detoxification techniques. But…"<br><br>Mun-Kyung's gaze, steadfast and unwavering, met mine.<br><br>"There may be a legendary treasure belonging to the Tang Family of Sichuan. A divine item said to detoxify any poison."<br><br>Ding.<br><br>\- A quest, \[Ring of All Poisons\] has been created!</p>
