                        <p>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord burst into laughter.<br><br>"I have to admit. You are the embodiment of supernatural strength."<br><br>He had personally rendered Jin Tae-Kyung's limbs useless and caused grave internal damage.<br><br>Being left disabled would have been a stroke of luck, but the extent of his injuries was such that death was a near certainty.<br><br>Yet, Jin Tae-Kyung lived.<br><br>He stood once more before the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, his body mended flawlessly and his Qi magnified.<br><br>'Dozens of healers together couldn't achieve this level of recovery.'<br><br>This was truly supernatural strength. It was a miracle.<br><br>A shiver of exhilaration and reverence ran through the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>Witnessing his shudder, Jin Tae-Kyung cocked his head, smirking.<br><br>"Does thinking of your imminent death make you want to pee? Why are you shaking like that?"<br><br>"Do you know how many years I've lived until now?"<br><br>"Don't know. Don't care."<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord gave a nod of acknowledgment.<br><br>"To confess, I don't know either."<br><br>"You asshole. Have you lost your mind?"<br><br>"As you age, counting the years becomes meaningless. Had I continued living like that, I might have chosen death out of boredom."<br><br>"Can't you just die now? I'm really serious. I could even get down on my knees to beg."<br><br>"Sorry, but right now I'm having more fun than I ever have. Just like when I met the Heavenly Lord in the past, today I met you."<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord's smile widened.<br><br>The preceding decades had been a tedious wait for him.<br><br>He longed for the chaos of battle and yearned for experiences yet undiscovered.<br><br>Neither the Poison King nor the Heaven-Stunning Shinni could quench his thirst for this elusive thrill.<br><br>That craving the Western Heavenly Demon Lord harbored was personified in the young man before him.<br><br>"Please promise me one thing."<br><br>His smile stretched unnaturally wide, tearing at the corners of his mouth.<br><br>His laughter, now twisted, made him the spitting image of a demon from the Lotus Sutra. \[Note: the Lotus Sutra is one of the most revered Mahayana Buddhist scriptures. It is known for its profound teachings, particularly the idea that all beings have the potential to achieve Buddhahood. In the Lotus Sutra, demons serve as metaphorical obstacles to enlightenment or as beings who challenge the practitioners' faith.\]<br><br>"Hold on for as long as possible."<br><br>Crack!<br><br>The ground trembled violently.<br><br>Dark energy surged from the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, enveloping him entirely.<br><br>As this paragon of power, with the capacity to shatter the skies, unsheathed his darkness-imbued sword, a sinister Sword Aura carved through the void, annihilating all in its wake.<br><br>Screech!<br><br>"You should also promise me something."<br><br>Jin Tae-Kyung tightened his hold on his spear.<br><br>The spear's blade, ablaze with azure flames, pierced the gloom like divine fire.<br><br>"Please die as soon as possible."<br><br>Boom!<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>A deafening explosion that seemed to rattle the heavens sent a vast shockwave down the length of the spear.<br><br>Crack!<br><br>Witnessing the dark Sword Aura collide with White Flames electrified me.<br><br>'There's a good chance of winning.'<br><br>This sentiment surged within me from the exchange.<br><br>The confrontation between the Sword Aura and the Spear Qi was monumental.<br><br>If 100 people were to choose which held the upper hand, ninety-nine would side with the Sword Aura.<br><br>And the lone dissenter would scoff, deeming the comparison ludicrous.<br><br>But...<br><br>'I can do this.'<br><br>In our initial skirmish, each of the Western Heavenly Demon Lord’s strikes forced me to retreat, leaving me with internal injuries.<br><br>However, the narrative has changed with the tremendous amount of Qi I received from the Heavenly Force Demon through the Transference of Power between Bodies.<br><br>I only retreated once.<br><br>The once distant Western Heavenly Demon Lord now seemed merely an arm's length away.<br><br>"Your newfound Qi is incredible, isn't it?"<br><br>Crackle.<br><br>The Spear Qi, overwhelmingly potent, stood unyielding even against the formidable Sword Aura.<br><br>As our weapons clashed, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord regarded me with a mix of respect and astonishment.<br><br>"I can assure you, there has never been a Peak Master like you in the history of Murim."<br><br>"You're probably right. They probably wouldn't have had more than three gapja of Qi." \[Note: just a quick reminder. The last time the amount of Qi was explicitly stated, the MC had 100 years worth of it. With this new information, it looks like we are sitting right around 180 years. This implies that the Heavenly Force Demon gave the MC at most 80 years worth of Qi.\]<br><br>I met his gaze and continued,<br><br>"Nor would they have this ability."<br><br>Before I even finished speaking, I was shouting commands in my mind.<br><br>'Grant 50 points each to strength and agility.'<br><br>The gifts from the Heavenly Force Demon weren't limited to Qi alone.<br><br>After leveling up ten times, I had healed completely and acquired the corresponding stat points.<br><br>Swoosh.<br><br>A radiant glow enveloped me.<br><br>A transformation, imperceptible to others but monumental to me, occurred in a heartbeat.<br><br>It was time to showcase this transformation.<br><br>"Put all your strength into 'Don't go.'" \[Note: the English words "Don't go" sound similar to the Korean word 똥꼬 (ttongkko), which means asshole. The MC is essentially telling the Western Heavenly Demon Lord "clench your asshole".\]<br><br>"Dongo?"<br><br>"Your asshole, you bastard."<br><br>I'm going to make you shit yourself.<br><br>I gritted my teeth, channeling power into my grip on the spear.<br><br>Grrrrr.<br><br>What are my stats now?<br><br>While the precise figures elude me, one truth is undeniable: my capabilities now vastly exceed human boundaries.<br><br>The smile vanished from the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's face, overwhelmed by the powerful force.<br><br>"Such foolishness...!"<br><br>"Attacking my intelligence is a low blow, you bastard."<br><br>It was indeed foolish, but it was also effective.<br><br>My spear, once at a disadvantage against his Sword Aura, now began to inch towards the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>'If your martial arts are lacking, make up for it in physical strength.'<br><br>A tactic only feasible for someone of my unique standing in this realm.<br><br>Yet, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's martial skills outshine mine significantly.<br><br>"Ha!"<br><br>Crack!<br><br>With a terse cry, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's sword traced an arcane path, encircling my spear.<br><br>It was a trick using the Art of Gentle Diversion.<br><br>As the spear blade cut through the air, the surroundings erupted. In that moment of disorientation, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord extended his hand.<br><br>Ssssssh!<br><br>A silent, intangible force shot forth. Invisible yet palpable, its direction and timing were unpredictable.<br><br>Instinctively, my body flowed like water.<br><br>I arched my back as far as it would go, grazing the ground.<br><br>Pffft!<br><br>Five sharp gusts from the Western Heavenly Demon Lord whisked past my face.<br><br>Droplets of blood flew, the metallic tang entwining with my senses.<br><br>As I rose swiftly with a kip-up, the dark Sword Aura slashed diagonally towards me.<br><br>Whoosh! Swoosh!<br><br>The narowly missed Sword Aura cleaved through the air.<br><br>The sheer force collapsed a pillar three jang away and sliced through prison bars as if they were soft tofu.<br><br>He was too close for a spear swing, but my strategy was clear.<br><br>'Open inventory. Store.'<br><br>As White Flames vanished, I extended my arms towards the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's torso.<br><br>Whoooosh!<br><br>The breath I exhaled was mixed with an intense heat.<br><br>Just as I readied my Divine Palm of Fire, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, having released his sword handle, moved so swiftly that he became blurred and suddenly struck me with both palms.<br><br>Boom!<br><br>The collision of our palms unleashed a tempest.<br><br>The rocky ground beneath us yielded, and the shockwave ripped through the vicinity.<br><br>But the real power lay between our hands.<br><br>'Ugh!'<br><br>I suppressed a groan.<br><br>A surge of energy from our interlocked palms briefly clouded my sight.<br><br>'Western Heavenly Demon Lord, you bastard. What kind of monstrous energy is this...'<br><br>The amount of Qi I currently possessed was a whopping three gapjas.<br><br>In terms of Qi alone, it was a level that could stand shoulder to shoulder with the leaders of the Nine Great Sects and the Five Great Families.<br><br>But the Western Heavenly Demon Lord was of a different dimension.<br><br>'This is crazy.'<br><br>Sssss.<br><br>The warmth in my palms ebbed away, soon overtaken by encroaching shadows.<br><br>A gentle murmur broke from the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>"Disappointment is unnecessary. A hastily erected tower will fall just as swiftly."<br><br>"......!"<br><br>"You are a strong child, but you will always be limited by the walls you cannot climb." \[Note: "the wall" being referrenced here and other places in the novel thus far refers to the barrier to the next realm, which in this case, is the Transcendent Realm.\]<br><br>Limited?<br><br>That single word involuntarily clenched my teeth.<br><br>It was a phrase I had heard throughout my life. A kid who grew up without a father, from a poor household, destined to live as an F-rank hunter until I died...<br><br>At every turn, the word "limited" was used to describe me and brush off my failures. The word followed me even to this moment, when I have achieved so much.<br><br>"You just wait..."<br><br>Puzzlement crossed the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's face at the vehemence in my tone.<br><br>I muttered, half in pain, warding off the relentless assault of his Qi.<br><br>"I'll shut that mouth of yours for good."<br><br>"......!"<br><br>A flicker of shock replaced his confusion.<br><br>With a surge of deep-seated strength, I began to advance, inch by inch.<br><br>I slowly forced the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's fingers back.<br><br>Crack.<br><br>The sound of dislocating bones made him furrow his brows.<br><br>"Your strength is indeed unmatched beneath the heavens. But this is as far as it goes."<br><br>Crack, pop!<br><br>It all happened in an instant.<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord propelled himself forward, knee connecting with my face.<br><br>My recently mended nose shattered, teeth scattering. I recoiled, hastily clearing the blood blurring my vision.<br><br>"Kuk!"<br><br>"Your limit is clear."<br><br>Whoosh, bang!<br><br>A punch, slicing through the air with a ferocious sound, was launched. I braced to block, yet the impact ruptured my eardrums. A flurry of blows descended as I faltered.<br><br>Thud thud thud!<br><br>Torso, abdomen, limbs — his unyielding assault targeted every part of me.<br><br>Yet, unlike our initial encounter, I neither yielded to the strikes nor succumbed to the ground.<br><br>'I've already been through this once. I can't be caught off guard a second time.'<br><br>Grasping at the faint afterimage, my hand found something solid — the arm of the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, unprotected by his Black Dragon Armor.<br><br>With no hesitation, I twisted his arm as if wringing out wet laundry.<br><br>Crack!<br><br>Flesh ripped, and bone shards erupted.<br><br>Skill aside, pain remains universal. The Western Heavenly Demon Lord threw a punch while trying to stiffle groan.<br><br>His attack, now sluggish and imprecise, presented no challenge to evade.<br><br>Bang!<br><br>A blast of compressed air exploded mere inches from my visage.<br><br>That's when my hand, swift as a lightning bolt, grasped his fist.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>A pause, as my eyes caught on an oddly familiar sight.<br><br>A ring with a small gem casting an enigmatic glow. Oddly, its presence had escaped my notice until now.<br><br>'Why does he have the Ring of All Poisons...?'<br><br>In that fleeting moment, countless thoughts raced through my mind.<br><br>The ensuing realization was promptly followed by the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's blow.<br><br>Thud!<br><br>Caught off-guard, evasion eluded me.<br><br>Reeling from the impact, I grabbed my buzzing head and stood up.<br><br>I had been hit, yet, inexplicably, I burst into laughter.<br><br>At my mirth, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's brow creased.<br><br>"Why are you laughing? Have you lost your mind?"<br><br>"My mind? No, it's you who lost."<br><br>With a laugh, I revealed the item clutched in my hand.<br><br>See it? It's the object I had acquired by putting it into my inventory. \[Note: I think this is the first time that the inventory skill has been used like this. We have seen him store objects that he holds on to before but they have always been in his own possession. In this instance, he essentially just touches it while it was on the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's finger and was able to store it. Wait...can he also do this to women's clothes? I'm surprised he hasn't used this skill on Song Song yet.\]<br><br>"You lost something important, right?"<br><br>"......!"<br><br>Silence fell as a storm of emotions passed over the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's face at the sight of the Ring of All Poisons.<br><br>Astonishment, surprise, bewilderment, followed swiftly by fury.<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord glanced at his now empty palm, his voice laden with gravity.<br><br>"How?"<br><br>"Well, perhaps it's the supernatural strength you're so fond of going crazy over."<br><br>A mere touch sufficed.<br><br>The Ring of All Poisons, transitioned from the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's possession into my inventory, now adorned my middle finger.<br><br>"For a divine artifact, it looks really good, doesn't it?"<br><br>"…Give it back. It's not something for the likes of you to possess."<br><br>I flipped off the Western Heavenly Demon Lord to showcase the ring.<br><br>"Pretty, isn't it?"<br><br>"…!"<br><br>His body shook with suppressed anger.<br><br>Gone was his usual composed facade, confirming my suspicion.<br><br>"The Ring of All Poisons. This was your goal from the beginning."<br><br>Seeing the Ring of All Poisons on the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's finger brought to mind the Green Jade Ruyi, pilfered by the Blood Lord amid the chaos at Shaolin.<br><br>"I thought there was something fishy when the Blood Lord desperately took the Green Jade Ruyi even while fleeing... Are you guys collecting artifacts? If you gather seven, does a dragon appear to grant your wishes?" \[Note: I hope you cultured scholars understand where this dragon reference is coming from.\]<br><br>Darkness shadowed the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's gaze.<br><br>"I told you to hand it over."<br><br>"Ah...hmm...fuck off."<br><br>I ostentatiously displayed the Ring of All Poisons on my finger.<br><br>Simultaneously, I commanded silently.<br><br>'Open inventory. Store.'<br><br>Like being wiped from existence, the ring vanished, eliciting a stunned reaction from the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>"Bastard…!"<br><br>Rumble.<br><br>The atmosphere tensed. His sword, summoned by Psychokinesis, flew into his hand.<br><br>Tsst tsst tsst!<br><br>His dark Sword Aura flared with unprecedented aggression and intent as he issued one final ultimatum.<br><br>"This is the last time I'll ask. Hand it over."<br><br>Transformed by the loss of his prized possession, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord now emanated a distinctly more menacing aura.<br><br>A faltering mind leads to an unsteady blade, presenting an opportunity to shift the battle's momentum.<br><br>"This is the last time I'll answer. No."<br><br>Upon hearing my defiance, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's eyes darkened profoundly.<br><br>"You brought this on yourself."<br><br>His voice, stripped of any feeling, propelled the shadowy Sword Aura, previously encircling his blade, straight forward like a bolt.<br><br>Yet, the target of its ruinous force wasn't my limb, torso, or throat.<br><br>It aimed for the far end of the ruined hallway, directly at the treatment room.<br><br>"No!"<br><br>With a desperate cry, I propelled myself forward.<br><br>My muscles, taut to the point of agony, voiced their protest, and the Qi I rallied in urgency grated against my veins.<br><br>It's okay. I can block it. I won't be too late.<br><br>'Grandfather!'<br><br>With a powerful thrust off the ground, I surged forward, stifling my outcry.<br><br>Boom!<br><br>As I moved, time seemed to stretch, a roar and a blinding light enveloped everything in that moment.</p>
