                        <p>Creak!<br><br>A massive rumble shook the ground.<br><br>A twenty-year-old hunter, Shao Shen, gazed at the horizon with disbelief etched on his face.<br><br>'How could monsters, supposed to be thousands of kilometers away, be here?'<br><br>Shao Shen wasn't the only one thinking this.<br><br>Everyone at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport shared this incredulity and horror at the reality confronting them. Approximately a thousand hunters from the Public Security Force and five thousand soldiers of the People's Liberation Army had been deployed to maintain order.<br><br>\- Screech!<br><br>\- Roar!<br><br>From low-tier monsters like goblins and orcs to their higher-tier counterparts - trolls, ogres, and lycanthropes.<br><br>The horizon was swarmed by a vast army of monsters, advancing with ferocious cries.<br><br>They quickly enclosed the mere kilometer between monsters and soldiers, inciting panic in all gathered at the airport.<br><br>"Form ranks for each unit! Assemble the formations!"<br><br>"Fire, fire! Fire, I said!"<br><br>Ratatatat!<br><br>Upon their superior's command, the People's Liberation Army hastily organized and unleashed a barrage of gunfire, albeit with minimal impact.<br><br>The onslaught of monsters was simply too massive for ordinary soldiers to make a dent.<br><br>These ordinary soldiers, devoid of any special powers or strengths, were frozen in fear, their gunfire barely effective against the low-tier monsters.<br><br>"There are too many monsters!"<br><br>"Pilot!"<br><br>"Quick, launch the fighter jets! Bombard them from above...!"<br><br>These urgent orders were instantly muffled by a thunderous roar from above.<br><br>\- Screech!<br><br>"T-that's...!"<br><br>"Wyvern! It's a wyvern!"<br><br>A colossal silhouette blocked the sunset.<br><br>A wyvern, known as the terror of the skies, led the charge, followed by scores of griffons and gargoyles.<br><br>The A-rank monsters, their vast wings slightly angled, swooped down on the yet-to-take-off fighter jets.<br><br>Thunk! Kwang!<br><br>Their mighty wings stirred the air, lifting tons of metal effortlessly, while their magic-infused talons shredded through the aircrafts' exteriors as if they were paper.<br><br>An explosion sent metal shards hurtling through the air with ferocious velocity, striking the pilots as they attempted a frantic escape.<br><br>Boom! Crack!<br><br>They met instantaneous deaths, void of even a single scream.<br><br>Obeying the commander's directives, gunfire erupted, but the magic-infused skin and hide of the creatures were merely grazed by the relentless barrage of bullets.<br><br>\- Kiakiak.<br><br>The monsters' taunts, ridiculing the humans' helplessness, sent shivers down the spine of every person, their hair standing on end from sheer terror and shock.<br><br>"This, this can't be."<br><br>The monstrous horde, dominating both land and sky, seemed invulnerable to the barrage of gunfire.<br><br>"Monsters..."<br><br>"I-I have to survive. I don't want to die in a place like this!"<br><br>The terror of impending death spread more swiftly than any disease.<br><br>As the People's Liberation Army began to retreat, one individual boldly advanced against the tide.<br><br>"Do not retreat!"<br><br>Shao Shen, a young man whose youthful spirit had not yet subsided, bellowed with eyes aflame with determination.<br><br>The Five-starred Red Flag of the People's Republic of China was prominently displayed on his armor.<br><br>"Who are we?"<br><br>His challenge halted those in mid-retreat, anchoring them in place.<br><br>Facing the monstrous onslaught mere hundreds of meters away, Shao Shen's voice, powerful and commanding, resonated from beneath his helmet.<br><br>"Who are we?"<br><br>His shout rallied the troops, stirring their spirits.<br><br>Before them all, Shao Shen lifted his spear.<br><br>"We are the descendants of China, brothers of the People's Liberation Army and the Ministry of Public Security and Military Affairs!"<br><br>A radiant aura burst from the spearhead, raised skyward as though to pierce the heavens itself.<br><br>Tsstsstsstss!<br><br>"Let's go! Let's eradicate these monsters!"<br><br>"Waaaaah!"<br><br>A thunderous roar from the assembled forces shook the ground beneath them.<br><br>At the forefront, hunters from the Public Security Force, weapons at the ready, charged towards the monstrous army with the ferocity of unleashed tigers.<br><br>"Do not retreat! Show the power of China!"<br><br>"Uaaaaah!"<br><br>\- Roar!<br><br>\- Howl!<br><br>Human cries of determination met with monstrous roars, intertwining into a chaotic fray.<br><br>Boom!<br><br>A clash thundered across the sky and earth, with death descending from every angle.<br><br>"Ahhh!"<br><br>\- Squeal!<br><br>Pop! Crunch!!<br><br>Echoes of screams and harsh noises filled the battlefield.<br><br>An A-rank hunter's blade, charged with aura, cleaved through a lycanthrope's neck, while an ogre, brandishing a massive club, sent several hunters flying.<br><br>As two hunters, pooling their efforts, downed one beast and turned to face another, a vast shadow enveloped them.<br><br>\- Screech!<br><br>Slash!<br><br>A griffon, swooping down swiftly, carved through hunters and their armor with its talons.<br><br>As the griffon sought its next victim, a fiery orb hurled towards it.<br><br>"Fireball!"<br><br>Boom!<br><br>Caught in the blast, the griffon fluttered amidst the acrid smoke. The ground-based ranged units, seizing the moment, unleashed their assault.<br><br>"Now!"<br><br>Bang! Boom!<br><br>Arrows, imbued with various magics and mana, struck the griffon.<br><br>With its cries of agony, the griffon plummeted, prompting ferocious roars from the other airborne creatures.<br><br>\- Kyaaah!<br><br>Modern weapons, forged from lead and iron, thwarted the aerial monster assault on the ranged units.<br><br>"Fire at will!"<br><br>Ratatatat! Boom!<br><br>A volley from countless rifles and heavy artillery, supported by dozens of tanks, unleashed simultaneously.<br><br>Though lacking the potency of mana, which was the natural counter to the monsters' magic, the concentrated barrage momentarily staggered the airborne threats.<br><br>\- Kiit!<br><br>"It's working!"<br><br>"Aim for the eyes!"<br><br>Magic-infused monsters withstand most physical assaults, but their eyes remain vulnerable.<br><br>A thin membrane shields their eyes, making them susceptible to damage from concentrated artillery fire.<br><br>Seeing the monsters hesitate, the division commander, fervently gestured with his baton.<br><br>"More! Pour it on! Make those monsters unable to move…"<br><br>Boom!<br><br>His command was abruptly silenced.<br><br>A green wyvern's venomous breath engulfed an area of about a hundred meters, dissolving the division commander and his staff in its potent acid.<br><br>"Commander!"<br><br>"The commander…"<br><br>In moments, the loss of numerous soldiers and senior officers plunged the People's Liberation Army into disarray.<br><br>Officers, volunteers, and soldiers alike were petrified, witnessing the unfolding catastrophe with screams of terror.<br><br>"This can't be happening…"<br><br>"This isn't right. It can't be! This isn't supposed happen!"<br><br>A collective cry of despair resonated with everyone's fears.<br><br>Although they were prepared for emergencies, their original task was to greet and guide foreign hunters at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport.<br><br>An assault by a monster legion was unforeseen and horrifying.<br><br>"What in the world…"<br><br>"We're going to die. We're all going to die."<br><br>A forgotten dread swiftly overshadowed the People's Liberation Army.<br><br>They were ordinary soldiers, not front-line hunters of the Public Security Force, armed merely with conventional weapons.<br><br>Their grim prediction soon morphed into a grim reality far beyond their darkest fears.<br><br>\- Feel...power...summon...creature. \[Note: This line as well as line 234 are a series of broken up Korean characters. Someone who speaks Korean may be able to decipher them, but I can't seem to find a good way to combine these characters so that they make sense. I may come back later, but for now, I have made up what I think is being said. For those that are curious, here is the raw Korean: 옴. 느. 하. 소. 유. and 옌. 위. 가. 지. 케!\]<br><br>An intermittent voice, like static from a poorly tuned radio, resonated across the battlefield.<br><br>A black mist, arising from nowhere and everywhere, enveloped the soldiers.<br><br>\- Rise...above...go...now!<br><br>Then, a horrifying transformation unfolded.<br><br>Swoosh!<br><br>Dark magic, like ominous clouds, spread over blood and corpses like a plague.<br><br>It imbued the fast-cooling bodies with newfound strength and a bond of servitude.<br><br>Crack, crackle.<br><br>From a deathly pool, a legion of skeletons arose, reanimated with sinister life.<br><br>'Those entities,' reveling in the enslavement of countless souls with unseen bonds, chuckled with dark satisfaction. \[Note: based on the context, I don't think this is the work of the boss monster that the MC came to Sichuan to fight. This seems to imply that there are several lower-level liches or necromancers in the area.\]<br><br>\- Kikiki.<br><br>\- Hehehe.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>\- Grrr.<br><br>Amidst the rumbling, a figure stood up.<br><br>Clad in armor adorned with the Five-starred Red Flag and wielding a massive axe, he bore a striking resemblance to the A-rank hunter Shao Shen remembered.<br><br>'...Yao Wei.'<br><br>Yet, Shao Shen remained silent, refraining from voicing the name.<br><br>For he understood that the being before him was no longer the comrade he once knew.<br><br>'Ahhh.'<br><br>If not for having seen Yao Wei's execution, and if the severed head was not now cradled under his arm, Shao Shen might have mistaken him for a friend.<br><br>But the man known as Yao Wei was gone. A different name escaped Shao Shen's lips.<br><br>"Dullahan..."<br><br>The headless knight. Dullahan. \[Note: I think that most are already familiar with this, but just in case: a Dullahan is a legendary creature in Irish folklore. He is depicted as a headless rider who rides a black horse and carries his own head.\]<br><br>The transformation of his friend into a formidable undead entity brought a heated tear to Shao Shen's eye.<br><br>"I'm sorry. Truly."<br><br>\- Roar!<br><br>Shao Shen surged forward like a gust, confronting the charging Dullahan with a battle cry.<br><br>Their past was filled with competitive sparring. What began as rivalry evolved into daily challenges, followed by light-hearted banter.<br><br>'This young brat has no manners. Would losing once hurt so much?'<br><br>'Haha. Let's go eat. Since the loser pays, it looks like Mr. Yao Wei is buying today.'<br><br>'I can't believe someone with so much money at home still lights up at the thought of a free meal. Someday, you'll be buying my food.'<br><br>Those days are now memories, with no chance of return. Shao Shen would always be the victor.<br><br>'Farewell. Thank you for everything.'<br><br>Whoosh! Slice!<br><br>The Dullahan's axe cleaved through the air, while the power from Shao Shen's spear tore through the Dullahan's torso.<br><br>A cut from waist to head. The figure of the headless knight gradually crumbled.<br><br>Thud, thump.<br><br>Shao Shen, peered down at the fallen Dullahan. As he stared at Yao Wei's face, his eyes lit with fury.<br><br>"How dare they. How dare they do this…"<br><br>Merely hours before, those who had shared laughter and camaraderie were now twisted into undead abominations.<br><br>The Public Security Force members, despite their rigorous discipline, were not devoid of empathy.<br><br>Though these soldiers were steeled for the possibility of death, they now truly felt the fear of their own mortality.<br><br>"Snap out of it! It's me, Liu Yin-Chin! Yin-Chin!"<br><br>"B-brother…"<br><br>\- Rumble!<br><br>Crash! Boom!<br><br>Screams and the specter of death enveloped them. The Public Security Force's numbers dwindled by half, while the monsters seemed to multiply, unrelentingly advancing.<br><br>'Is this how I die?'<br><br>Shao Shen faced the concept of his mortality for the first time, the gravity of the situation dimming even his resilient spirit to thoughts of despair.<br><br>'Since we didn't receive any warning signals, communication must be down, and no support is coming... this is really the end.'<br><br>Swoosh!<br><br>As Shao Shen cleaved through the encroaching undead, he gazed skyward with a bitter chuckle.<br><br>The sunset was breathtaking. Soon, as night fell and darkness came, such a sight would never be seen again.<br><br>'It's fortunate. For the last sky I see, this isn't too bad...'<br><br>Huh?<br><br>Shao Shen blinked, unable to continue his thought.<br><br>Something massive was rapidly approaching the battlefield from the sky.<br><br>'A plane?'<br><br>Boom!<br><br>A fiery explosion illuminated the sky, followed by a shout that cut through the chaos.<br><br>"Watch out, there are monsters!"<br><br>"......?"<br><br>\- ......?<br><br>Yes, of course there were monsters... What uneccessary declaration was this?<br><br>Not just Shao Shen, but all eyes on the battlefield shifted upwards.<br><br>This frenzied proclamation resounded, stirring the air.<br><br>"Smash them!"<br><br>Smash them? What?<br><br>Shao Shen soon realized the meaning of those words.<br><br>Kugugugung!<br><br>The massive body of the plane swept across the battlefield.</p>
