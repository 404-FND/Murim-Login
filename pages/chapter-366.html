                        <p>Drip, drip-drip-drip.<br><br>The world was submerged in a darkness so profound that time seemed immeasurable.<br><br>Dark clouds crowded the sky, and a relentless rain poured down from the heavens.<br><br>Pools of blood overflowed on the Tang Family of Sichuan's grounds, and corpses were piled into small mounds.<br><br>“So, what’s the situation inside?”<br><br>At the entrance to the Tang Family of Sichuan, a figure in black inquired as he sat on the corpse of a fallen martial artist.<br><br>“The conflict is ongoing. About a hundred people remain.”<br><br>“What? That many?”<br><br>“Only half of them are martial artists. The rest are craftsmen, women, or children who have not learned martial arts.”<br><br>"Then, eliminating them should be straightforward. Why the delay?"<br><br>The figure in black showed evident displeasure, frustrated by the prolonged duty of guarding the entrance while others collected their merits.<br><br>“Well, that is…”<br><br>“Is there a complication?”<br><br>The subordinate hurriedly continued, seeing his superior’s furrowed brows.<br><br>“Some of the remaining martial artists of the Tang Family are elites, but the operation is delayed because they activated their hidden traps.”<br><br>“Hidden traps? It should not be difficult to destroy if it’s poison.”<br><br>“It’s not poison, but explosives. They were hiding the Heaven-Shaking Thunder.” \[Note: this is the same thing that the Blood Lord used to lure Hong Dao away from the Grand Celestial Banquet.\]<br><br>“…You can’t mean the Heaven-Shaking Thunder from the Thunderbolt Sect that I know of.” \[Note: I am uncertain if this means the "Thunderbolt Sect" or the "Thunderbolt Family". However, I am more confident that this is a Sect, because it is unlikely that Thunderbolt is some family's last name (although this would be a kick-ass last name. Imagine naming your kid Hurricane with this last name). But in any case, it is not a current living faction in Murim, as we will find out soon enough.\]<br><br>“It appears so. Our forces sustained significant losses due to the unexpected deployment of the Heaven-Shaking Thunder."<br><br>“What madness is this.”<br><br>Astonishment was clear on the black-clothed figure’s face. The unexpected loud noise had hinted at trouble, but the presence of the legendary Heaven-Shaking Thunder, presumed lost with the demise of the Thunderbolt Sect, was shocking.<br><br>Victory's delay seemed understandable now.<br><br>“Wait, then what has the Western Heavenly Demon Lord been doing? He could have slaughtered them all by now.”<br><br>The query conveyed unwavering confidence in the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>As the Western Heavenly Demon Lord was one of the few beings capable of understanding the Almighty Heavenly Lord's commands and wielded immense divine power, unwavering confidence was warranted.<br><br>Not even the incredibly powerful Heaven-Shaking Thunder could harm the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>"I’ve been informed that he ventured into the Tang Family’s underground prison about an hour ago."<br><br>Understanding dawned on the black-clothed figure upon hearing the subordinate’s report.<br><br>If the Western Heavenly Demon Lord had intervened personally, there was undoubtedly a valid reason. The situation would be resolved flawlessly. There was neither cause for concern nor doubt.<br><br>This sentiment was shared not only by the figure in black but also by all who were present.<br><br>"Then, what about the First Monster?"<br><br>The First Monster, the eldest of the Monstrous Trio of Qilian serving under the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, was renowned for his strength.<br><br>The subordinate paused briefly before responding.<br><br>"He's currently locked in a fierce battle with the Sword Saint's heir in the inner courtyard. After one of our own was decapitated while reporting on the Heaven-Shaking Thunder, no one has dared to approach."<br><br>"…I see."<br><br>The figure in black kept his response succinct.<br><br>While admiration and trust were reserved for the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, the First Monster inspired fear. The risk of meeting a grisly fate for careless words was too great.<br><br>"Um, Unit Leader?"<br><br>"Do you have something to say?"<br><br>"Yes, the Unit Vice Leader asked about the news from the brothers who went to Qingcheng and Emei."<br><br>"A letter arrived just before you did."<br><br>Upon receiving a slender container from the figure in black, the subordinate examined it with a puzzled look.<br><br>"This is…"<br><br>"It's from Emei."<br><br>"Is this the only one?"<br><br>"Yes. We haven’t heard anything from Qingcheng yet."<br><br>"He has surpassed the agreed upon time."<br><br>"That's true. But you know what kind of people the other Unit Leaders are."<br><br>The Monstrous Trio of Qilian were notorious not just for their fearsome appearance.<br><br>Each was known for their cruelty and unpredictable wrath, easily provoked by the sight of blood.<br><br>Yet, the Third Monster, overseeing Emei, proved somewhat more reliable, having dispatched the report punctually.<br><br>The situation in Emei, as detailed in the correspondence, was far from favorable.<br><br>'The Beggar Sect has intervened.'<br><br>Unexpectedly, swordsmen armed with sticks and the iconic dog-beating staffs of the Beggar Sect had made an appearance.<br><br>Although individually their martial prowess may not match that of Dark Heaven's martial artists, the implications were profound.<br><br>'They've caught the scent already.'<br><br>The assault, planned to be swift and decisive, was now dragged out by these unforeseen elements. Nevertheless, the man in black maintained confidence in their ultimate victory.<br><br>Dismissing a momentary unease, his attention was abruptly drawn elsewhere.<br><br>"Hmm?"<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>"What is that?"<br><br>Confusion laced the voice of the figure in black as the subordinate, along with around thirty martial artists stationed across the ramparts, converged around their Unit Leader.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, they observed it.<br><br>Beyond the deteriorating ramparts, a gust cut sharply through the rain, moving with such speed it resembled a bolt of light, culminating in a dazzling explosion.<br><br>Sssssshhh, crack!<br><br>The group of martial artists blinked in unison. Touching their faces instinctively, they found their hands covered in sticky blood.<br><br>Slowly, their mouths agape in horror, they turned their heads.<br><br>As time seemed to slow, they saw the body of their Unit Leader crumble like a rotten tree.<br><br>A hole the size of a fingernail was pierced through his forehead.<br><br>"……!"<br><br>Silence enveloped them while a silent shockwave hit them all.<br><br>Their Unit Leader, a Peak Master revered across the heavens for his prowess, was felled by an invisible assault.<br><br>As they grappled with this shock, a silhouette ascended the wall.<br><br>And the next moment.<br><br>Shhhhhh!<br><br>A lethal light struck swiftly from the darkness.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>The First Monster teetered on the edge of insanity. In truth, he had been ensnared by madness for over fifty years, but now his condition worsening with each passing moment.<br><br>"Why! Why! How!"<br><br>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br><br>His double axes unleashed a blood-red Qi, wreaking havoc in all directions.<br><br>The once grand hall of the Tang Family of Sichuan's Patriarch was now nothing but rubble.<br><br>Amidst this chaos, a figure deftly maneuvered, evading the onslaught.<br><br>"Ah! Eeh! Eeng! Huk!"<br><br>Witnessing Cheong Pung's agile dodges and weaves, the First Monster's eyes bulged with disbelief.<br><br>"This damn mutt……!"<br><br>It was enough to drive anyone mad.<br><br>The opponent was barely more than a child. His background as a disciple of the Sword Saint and having achieved Transcendence shouldn't bridge the chasm carved by time.<br><br>The First Monster, a daunting figure from a bygone era, wielded immense strength and wisdom, and was still a martial artist of the highest caliber.<br><br>Thus, at first, he might have been surprised but did not feel any significant sense of danger.<br><br>'The Sword Saint has nurtured quite the exceptional talent. The Demon Lord's cautionary advice makes sense now. But he has a long way to go before he can contend with me. Haha.'<br><br>But his smirk soon morphed into fury.<br><br>"Die! I said die!"<br><br>He roared maniacally as his double axe descended, unleashing a surge of Qi that enveloped Cheong Pung.<br><br>The Crimson Slaughter Net. This technique, a legacy of the Crimson Slaughter Demon who bathed the jianghu in blood three centuries ago, was infamous. \[Note: direct translation - Red Killing Asura Net.\]<br><br>As a pariah of the Murim in the Central Plains, the infamous assassin met his demise in a secluded cave on Mount Qilian. The three brothers, having secluded themselves from society, mastered the martial arts detailed in the demon's manuscripts, emerging as the Monstrous Trio of Qilian.<br><br>And now, the Crimson Slaughter Net, a technique that no one had been able to perform since the Crimson Slaughter Demon, was being reproduced by the First Monster's double axe.<br><br>Swoosh!<br><br>That instant marked a pivotal moment.<br><br>As Cheong Pung watched the incoming tide of red Qi, his gaze intensified.<br><br>Whoosh-<br><br>A serene breeze accompanied the purple Sword Aura encircling his blade, effortlessly slicing the Qi net at an angle.<br><br>Screech!<br><br>The Unified Wisdom Sword, wielded by Cheong Pung, neutralized the formidable Crimson Slaughter Net, stunning the First Monster. \[Note: direct translation - Unified Character Wisdom Sword.\]<br><br>"Do you know the martial arts of the Crimson Slaughter Demon?"<br><br>No martial art is without its flaws.<br><br>Despite being regarded as supreme techniques, the arts of the Crimson Slaughter Demon had their vulnerabilities. These secrets were closely guarded by the Monstrous Trio of Qilian.<br><br>Yet, the opponent had accurately identified that vulnerability.<br><br>"Aren't you going to respond?"<br><br>Cheong Pung's reply was prompt and to the point.<br><br>"What's a Crimson Slaughter Demon? This is my first time hearing of it."<br><br>"…What?"<br><br>"Oh, are you wondering how I countered it?"<br><br>Continuing with a tilt of his head, Cheong Pung added.<br><br>"I just learned it."<br><br>"Did you say learn?"<br><br>"If you watch closely, you can learn anything. It just took a bit longer because I'm used to learning from my grandfather. He has more energy and his martial arts are more complex." \[Note: Cheong Pung is saying that he's so used to complex martial arts that he over-complicated things and it took him longer to study the First Monster's moves.\]<br><br>"It took longer?"<br><br>"Yes. But it seems I won't need to watch anymore."<br><br>"……!"<br><br>The First Monster realized what Cheong Pung's last words meant in the next moment.<br><br>Swoosh!<br><br>A purplish glow suddenly dominated his view.<br><br>Caught off guard, the First Monster instinctively dispersed his axes with lightning speed to counter the incoming sword strike.<br><br>Despite the lack of finesse, the Crimson Slaughter Eighteen Axes boasted unparalleled destructive might. Enhanced by Qi exceeding two gapja, they seemed capable of cleaving the heavens and earth.<br><br>However...<br><br>Crack!<br><br>The sword's blade, with seamless precision, deflected one axe away while simultaneously countering another aimed at Cheong Pung's side.<br><br>Boom!<br><br>The clash resulted in a reverberating impact, sending the First Monster reeling back, axes in hand, his expression a mix of shock and confusion.<br><br>'W-what on earth just happened?'<br><br>Whoosh!<br><br>Cheong Pung advanced rapidly towards the First Monster.<br><br>His gaze intensified, and a sunset-hued purplish energy emanated from his sword.<br><br>Whoosh!<br><br>The First Monster, dazed, watched as the strike targeted his head.<br><br>'T-this is...'<br><br>Undoubtedly. The Crimson Slaughter Eighteen Axes. Or rather, now it should be termed the Crimson Slaughter Eighteen Swords.<br><br>In mere moments, Cheong Pung had not only unraveled the First Monster's martial technique but had also adopted it as his own.<br><br>'How could this be possible!'<br><br>With a silent gasp of disbelief, the First Monster launched his axes into action.<br><br>Despite the initial shock hampering his speed, he wasn't rendered helpless.<br><br>Or so he believed, until Cheong Pung's sword maneuvered anew.<br><br>Whoosh.<br><br>The sword's potent and ruinous energy descended gently, akin to drifting petals. Thirty-six plum blossoms materialized from the sword's tip, cascading through the air.<br><br>A specific martial technique dawned on the First Monster.<br><br>'Thirty-Six Plum Blossom Sword.'<br><br>Simultaneously, a realization struck.<br><br>'It's unavoidable.'<br><br>Sssssshhhhh!<br><br>Thirty-six plum blossoms, or rather, blades of Qi, shrouded the First Monster. \[Note: think back to chapter 182 of the manhwa when the Sword Saint used this same move on the Blood Lord.\]<br><br>His blood misted the air, and, riddled with cuts, the First Monster stumbled backward.<br><br>A glint of fear flashed in his eyes upon seeing Cheong Pung, who had just sheathed his sword.<br><br>"Cough, you...you..."<br><br>"Oh, good. It's raining."<br><br>Cheong Pung's voice was steady and composed.<br><br>"I hate the smell of blood."<br><br>Squish.<br><br>Cheong Pung's foot stepped into a puddle of rain and blood. The First Monster screamed in agony.<br><br>"Is anyone still here? Quickly! Kill this mutt...!"<br><br>Just then, a whisper reached his ears.<br><br>"Don't bother calling. You're alone."<br><br>"……!"<br><br>"……!"<br><br>Not a sound of footsteps, not a hint of presence, and yet, he was unmistakably there.<br><br>The rain seemed to evaporate before it could even graze him.<br><br>"Who are you...?"<br><br>Squeak!<br><br>With a swift motion, the First Monster's head was severed, flying into the air. Cheong Pung, flicking his sword to clear the blood, now stood before the intruder.<br><br>"I'd like to ask. Who might you be?"<br><br>Cheong Pung's voice wavered slightly as he continued speaking.<br><br>"Mun-Kyung?"</p>
