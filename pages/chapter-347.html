                        <p>The subterranean cells of the Sichuan Tang Family were shrouded in darkness and humidity with an eerie chill permeating the air.<br><br>This ambiance seemed fitting, given the countless souls that had perished within these walls.<br><br>"Would you like something to drink?"<br><br>The old man offering a battered gourd was like the grim reaper.<br><br>I pondered the number of lives this small, stooped figure had claimed before responding.<br><br>"I'm fine."<br><br>"Suit yourself."<br><br>Gulp, gulp.<br><br>After a hearty swig from his gourd, the old man dabbed his mouth with his ragged sleeve, marked with what looked ominously like bloodstains.<br><br>"Ah, that's good."<br><br>A strong scent of alcohol mingled with the smell of blood wafting through the corridor.<br><br>Drinking on the job? In the Jin Family of Taiyuan, this would warrant a severe reprimand, but it seems like the rules don't apply in the underground prison of the Tang Family of Sichuan.<br><br>"I've heard you're quite the figure in Murim."<br><br>It was clear whom he was referring to. Cheong Pung and Tang Sa-Mun had disappeared hours ago, and the Divine Doctor and Mun-Kyung were busy turning the cellblock into a makeshift clinic.<br><br>I reluctantly answered.<br><br>"I'm not all that remarkable."<br><br>"That's not what I've heard. Being a successor of the Fire King, you could even pee on the signboard of one of the Nine Great Sects, so they say."<br><br>His grin, showcasing decayed teeth, was unsettling.<br><br>"The one who did such a deed is locked up here."<br><br>"What kind of deed are you talking about?"<br><br>"The one who peed on the signboard of one of the Nine Great Sects. It was the Kunlun Sect, if I recall correctly."<br><br>"…Truly, all sorts of people are here."<br><br>"Heh heh. He was once recognized as a Demon Head of the Demonic Cult, but he’s now just bound and constantly leaking blood and filth. You must have seen him on your way here?"<br><br>"I guess so."<br><br>Navigating the Tang Family's dungeon felt like traversing a labyrinth, its corridors twisted and filled with cells. From what I witnessed upon entry, it housed numerous inmates.<br><br>'That guy who peed on the Kunlun Sect's signboard must be one of those prisoners.'<br><br>They were paying the price for their misdeeds, and not a trace of sympathy arose in me.<br><br>No, it would be more accurate to say I had no time to care about such things.<br><br>'I didn’t expect to feel this nervous.'<br><br>Ever since I stepped into the shadowy confines of the Sichuan Tang Family's dungeon, an unsettling feeling has clung to me.<br><br>It reminded me of the anxious anticipation I felt years ago as I awaited news from the surgery room where my mother was.<br><br>'Everything will be okay. It has to be.'<br><br>While whispering reassurances to myself, the heavy door to the dungeon swung open, releasing a stream of servants laden with cleaning supplies into the corridor.<br><br>To the last person emerging, I inquired,<br><br>"Is it finished?"<br><br>With a reassuring smile, the Divine Doctor confirmed.<br><br>In just a few hours, the gloomy cell had been converted into a makeshift yet serviceable medical chamber.<br><br>"It's not yet up to satisfactory levels, but it's somewhat presentable now."<br><br>"Then..."<br><br>"Yes. It's time to begin."<br><br>Finally, all preparations were completed.<br><br>The various medicines created from twenty-four types of herbs mined from the Frozen Tundra had already been brought in. With the medical chamber prepared, only one step remained.<br><br>"Thank you all for your hard work. Could you please step aside for a moment?"<br><br>Heeding my request, the Tang Family's personnel, including the old man with his gourd, stepped back. I waited for the space to clear before delving into my pocket.<br><br>'Inventory open, summon.'<br><br>A hard object filled my previously empty hand. For safety reasons, I had been holding onto the Ring of All Poisons, which I now handed over to the Divine Doctor.<br><br>With the ring now on his finger, the Divine Doctor motioned towards the interior of the cell.<br><br>"Could you bring the patient over?"<br><br>I maneuvered the stretcher forward, revealing a barely breathing figure.<br><br>"Over here."<br><br>I stepped into the prison, holding Jeok Cheon-Gang. The floor was clean, but there was still a lingering stench.<br><br>But that didn't matter. I could only focus on how light Jeok Cheon-Gang felt.<br><br>'He's gotten much weaker.'<br><br>It had been about a month and a half since we left the Murim Alliance of Hanam for this journey.<br><br>I found the Divine Doctor much faster than expected for the treatment, but Jeok Cheon-Gang was growing weaker by the day.<br><br>Sigh.<br><br>Gently, I laid him on a white, smooth stone in the center of the room.<br><br>This Cold Ice Stone, gifted by Tang Sa-Dok, was chosen by the Divine Doctor as a crucial element for Jeok Cheon-Gang's recovery.<br><br>"He's sleeping peacefully."<br><br>Jeok Cheon-Gang's features, though emaciated, radiated tranquility as he lay before me.<br><br>I gazed intently at his face which was marked by wrinkles and age spots.<br><br>I was transported back to our first encounter.<br><br>'What an interesting fellow.' \[Note: manhwa chapter 114.\]<br><br>'The more I see you, the more strange I find you. Where did you say you were from?' \[Note: manhwa chapter 115.\]<br><br>I vividly remembered the cantankerous old man I had met at Jang Tae-Bo's house a year ago.<br><br>'This inn has gotten too old... The rain's leaking through the roof.' \[Note: manhwa chapter 118.\]<br><br>I remembered a mentor mourning his inability to protect his pupil, blaming the fully intact roof while shedding tears of regret.<br><br>'If you kill him, you'll die too.' \[Note: manhwa chapter 127.\]<br><br>'I entrusted the Divine Object of the Scorching Clan to him.' \[Note: manhwa chapter 128.\]<br><br>'I'll teach you all that I know!' \[Note: manhwa chapter 149.\]<br><br>From Shanxi to Henan, from Henan to Anhui, and the year spent at Mount Jiuhua. I remembered every moment we spent together.<br><br>Jeok Cheon-Gang had led me out of the Jin Family of Taiyuan, and I followed him into the vast world. We were always together.<br><br>'How was it, just as this old man said?'<br><br>'What are you talking about?'<br><br>'The Ghostly Dance of the Fire God. Wasn’t it spectacular?' \[Note: all three lines are from manhwa chapter 179.\]<br><br>His expression, tinged with a gentle smile amidst bouts of coughing blood, remains vivid in my mind.<br><br>And under the glow of a full moon, he spoke, masking his sincerity with casual words.<br><br>'Master? What Master? Just call me Grandfater.' \[Note: this is from manhwa chapter 132. Although not directly shown in the manhwa, this is probably something from the novel that was skipped.\]<br><br>"Grandfather."<br><br>I know that even if I call out, he won't answer.<br><br>I don't call out because I hope he will hear, but because there are words I wish to say.<br><br>"You know what?"<br><br>How could I possibly know, you brat!<br><br>A chuckle escaped me as I heard his voice on the chilly breeze. I gripped Jeok Cheon-Gang's wrinkled hand tightly and whispered.<br><br>"I always wanted to call you Master." \[Note: the MC is technically not the Fire King's disciple. The Fire King is in the MC's debt for taking care of Jo-Pil for him (manhwa chapter 119). So the Fire King is teaching him as a repayment for that debt, and is very adamant that the MC is not his disciple. Fire King, AKA Tsundere King.\]<br><br>Somewhere along our journey, it became clear to me.<br><br>He had become my Master, and I, his disciple.<br><br>In our hearts, we both secretly valued this sacred bond.<br><br>"Young Master Jin. The time has come."<br><br>Heeding the Divine Doctor's call, I diverted my attention from Jeok Cheon-Gang's face.<br><br>With a composed expression, I respectfully performed a bow towards the elderly physician and his young disciple.<br><br>"Please take good care of my Master."<br><br>Their acknowledgments came through equivalent gestures of commitment.<br><br>"I will do my utmost."<br><br>"I, too, will do everything in my power to assist Master."<br><br>Their assurances were all the solace I needed. Now was the time to trust in their skills and in fate itself.<br><br>We have done everything that humans can do, so all that is left is to leave it to the Heaven.<br><br>God, Buddha, Allah, or the Jade Emperor.<br><br>'Whoever it may be, if you help just this once, I will never forget it.'<br><br>Though I do not believe in gods, I do believe there is an omnipotent being above us.<br><br>In a moment of silent supplication to this undefined power, the Divine Doctor's grave tone broke through.<br><br>"Remember, fifteen days. No one should approach until then."<br><br>What if it takes longer than fifteen days?<br><br>I repressed the question, choosing instead to place my faith in their capabilities. I vowed to the three of them:<br><br>"I will protect him with my life, no matter who may come for us."<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>"Is that all?"<br><br>The scrutiny in the middle-aged man's gaze was unyielding as it fell upon the figure before him.<br><br>Contorted limbs and stripped flesh — the sight was ghastly. The victim's voice was as thin as a whisper.<br><br>"Yes, I've told you all I know..."<br><br>"Isn't the most crucial part missing?"<br><br>"I don't know. I really don't."<br><br>Blood-stained tears escaped the solitary eye he had left, and his blood-soaked garments were now also stained with urine.<br><br>With a voice shaking from terror, he pleaded.<br><br>"Just kill me now, please..."<br><br>The middle-aged man, observing the dimming light in the man's eyes, tutted in acknowledgment.<br><br>"It seems you're telling the truth."<br><br>The man had endured unimaginable torture for half a day.<br><br>The man's plea for death, rather than life, underscored his honesty.<br><br>Until now, no one had ever lied in front of the middle-aged man.<br><br>Except for one person: the Poison King Tang Sa-Mun.<br><br>"Your half-day's worth of spirit, I've seen it well. Now, you may rest."<br><br>Swish, thud!<br><br>With a swift motion, the life of the man, once a diligent operative within the Tang Family's Green Shadow Squad, was claimed by a mere flick, granting him a tranquil demise.<br><br>The middle-aged figure observed the lifeless form below, then gestured grandly.<br><br>Bang!<br><br>A loud noise followed, and a pit one jang deep appeared.<br><br>Subsequently, the bodies of five others that were scattered around were stacked neatly in the pit. The task of concealing them beneath the earth was accomplished in mere moments.<br><br>"The Green Shadow Squad... they're like flies."<br><br>He spoke softly, his gaze piercing through the mountainous terrain towards the west, in the direction of the stronghold of the Tang Family of Sichuan.<br><br>'I should have killed Tang Sa-Dok when I first found him.'<br><br>That oversight had proven costly. The Poison King's defiance was more robust than anticipated, leading to a prolonged battle to neutralize the poison and resulting in the loss of his arm.<br><br>Against lesser factions like the Emei or Qingcheng Sects, such a disadvantage might be inconsequential. However, the fortified and vigilant Tang Family posed a significant challenge. Now, diminished by his injury, a solo assault seemed foolhardy.<br><br>'However, it only extends their lifeline by a few more days. The outcome will not change.'<br><br>The machinations within Sichuan, encompassing the Emei Sect, Qingcheng Sect, and Tang Family, were already under his surveillance.<br><br>The strategy to eliminate the three tigers lurking within Sichuan was set.<br><br>It was now time to summon the hunters.<br><br>Swoosh!<br><br>The middle-aged man moved as if gliding, with each step erasing vast distances.<br><br>Finally, his steps halted at a cliff deep within the mountains.<br><br>"This is the place."<br><br>He approached the cliff and, with a deliberate touch, initiated a remarkable transformation.<br><br>Wooong.<br><br>With a resonating echo, the cliff crumbled away.<br><br>No, it was more accurate to say that space itself twisted. Weathered stones and rocks vanished, revealing an open cavity that had been concealed.<br><br>'The sorcery of the Qi Entrance Array is always astonishing to behold.'<br><br>Yet, what he was about to undertake dwarfed such feats in comparison.<br><br>Crunch, crunch, crunch.<br><br>Advancing into the chamber's heart, where arcane symbols were inscribed, he positioned himself at the epicenter, ready to harness his profound energy.<br><br>As the eerie, dark crimson haze enveloped him and touched the arcane symbols, he shouted,<br><br>"Long live the Heavenly Lord!"<br><br>Fwoosh!<br><br>With the middle-aged man's cry, the pattern lit up. A black brilliance that was both dark and bright filled the cavern, indescribable in its essence.<br><br>Then, as the light receded, the cavern was filled with a resonating declaration.<br><br>"We greet the Western Heavenly Demon Lord!"<br><br>"We greet the Demon Lord!"<br><br>Arrayed before him were hundreds of elite warriors, their presence defined by indifferent gazes and lethal intent, all uniformly garbed in somber black robes.<br><br>Observing them, the lips of the middle-aged man, now revealed as the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, curved into a subtle smile, acknowledging the assembly of his formidable tiger hunters.</p>
