                        <p>The body succumbs once the head is severed.<br><br>Once the three ringleaders were subdued, their undead minions ceased their motion as if they were puppets. The once-cohesive force now disbanded into chaos, with members either perishing or escaping.<br><br>"Arch Lich?"<br><br>To my query, the three bastards, now forced into submission, affirmed with a nod.<br><br>Though referring to these reanimated, skeletal beings as 'bastards' feels odd, it somehow seems fitting.<br><br>I caressed their skulls one by one, prodding them further.<br><br>"People are supposed to answer when spoken to. Do you think it's okay to be rude because you're dead?"<br><br>Their responses were immediate.<br><br>\- Yes. Yes. Arch Lich.<br><br>\- What you have heard is correct, human.<br><br>\- Yes.<br><br>"Hmm. Arch Lich. That's a new type of monster for me... But who was the one who answered impolitely at the end?"<br><br>\- That guy!<br><br>\- How dare you, in front of the great human!<br><br>Whish, whish!<br><br>A pair of bare fingers pointed at one of them.<br><br>Betrayed by his comrades in a flash, the accused's skull trembled.<br><br>\- No! This is a vile slander!<br><br>"...I don't think it's slander."<br><br>If you're going to lie, you might as well change your tone.<br><br>Surveying my surroundings, I retrieved 'it' from my inventory.<br><br>"Golgol, time for a treat." \[Note: golgol is derived from an onomatopoeia for a sound of something rolling or rattling.\]<br><br>A singular skull, distinguished by an unusual black luster and eyes aglow with flickering flames.<br><br>\- ...Golgol? I'd rather you call me Warlordmon like before.<br><br>"I think Golgol fits perfectly for a skull."<br><br>\- I can't believe you insult this commander this way.<br><br>"Well, if you don't like it, too bad."<br><br>Afraid of being stowed away, the Skeleton Warlord declared with vehemence.<br><br>\- I accept the treat with gratitude!<br><br>"You're an honest child, aren't you?"<br><br>Rewards must be given to an honest child. Punishment must be given to bad guys who lie.<br><br>"Now, go ahead and taste it."<br><br>\- Thank you. You are slightly less wicked, human. But how much should I eat...?<br><br>"Just a little, like before."<br><br>\- Hmm. I want to eat more. But I understand.<br><br>Indulgence must be moderated. The Skeleton Warlord, his disappointment barely concealed, opened his jaws wide before the quivering entity.<br><br>\- Now come here.<br><br>\- Eeek, no!<br><br>\- Yes!<br><br>With a steadfast proclamation, the Skeleton Warlord initiated a remarkable transformation.<br><br>Swoosh!<br><br>The spectacle never ceases to amaze.<br><br>The kneeling figure’s essence, a black mist described as "death energy" by the Skeleton Warlord, commenced its transfer as if it were being drawn into a vortex.<br><br>\- Huuuurgh!<br><br>The transformation did not stop there.<br><br>As the black mist kept flowing, the source's bones turned progressively whiter.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Skeleton Warlord's black sheen became even deeper and richer.<br><br>\- Stop, stop!<br><br>\- Huhuhu. Such delicious death energy.<br><br>\- No!<br><br>\- This commander will take it all. Death energy!<br><br>Snap!<br><br>\- Hup!<br><br>"'Death energy.' Where do you learn such weird things?"<br><br>\- Are you one to talk?<br><br>"Anyway, stop eating now."<br><br>\- Why!<br><br>"You'll get fat."<br><br>Cradling the dumbfounded Skeleton Warlord in my arms, I turned to the diminished figure before us.<br><br>The once shadowy bones have transitioned to a paler hue, a transformation likely tied to the significant depletion of death energy, as evidenced by the unstable flicker of the green flames in their eye sockets.<br><br>\- Gulp, sob.<br><br>Witnessing their comrade's weakened state, the other two nervously clacked their teeth.<br><br>\- Ask us anything. O great Lord of Flames.<br><br>\- Please, I beg of you. Accept the loyalty of this insignificant being, Orpheus von Maximus Valencia Bayern.<br><br>"...So you're a bidet, not undead?" \[Note: the Korean for Bayern and bidet are somewhat phonetically similar, so just another wordplay here.\]<br><br>Their reluctance to part with their power is palpable. Nevertheless, their readiness to cooperate is appreciated.<br><br>"Now, if there's anything you haven't told me, spill it. If you've spread any lies..."<br><br>\- We will tell you everything!<br><br>\- Please, allow this deceitful and insignificant being to tell the truth!<br><br>\- I-I will tell you.<br><br>Driven by fear of sharing the previous fate, the trio eagerly engaged in the interrogation.<br><br>After learning of the events from the Arch Lich's emergence to the present, my expression darkened with concern.<br><br>"Are you sure?"<br><br>\- Yes, we swear!<br><br>\- We swear on the River of Death!<br><br>\- Not a single falsehood exists.<br><br>As the trio nodded with fervor, the Skeleton Warlord interjected.<br><br>\- It's true.<br><br>"Did they pay you off? How can you guarantee that?"<br><br>\- Because they swore on the River of Death. For beings like us, that is an absolute promise that cannot be violated.<br><br>"Hmm."<br><br>His sincerity, a departure from his usual nonchalance, lent credibility to his words.<br><br>In this dire strait, deception seemed unlikely.<br><br>"Okay. I'll trust you."<br><br>\- Thank you! Thank you so much!<br><br>\- Kuhuhuhu! I will devote my utmost loyalty, my king!<br><br>\- I, no, we will also serve you, human. We swear on the River of Death that we will never commit the same actions as today again...<br><br>Crack!<br><br>The final speaker paused, cut off before they could conclude.<br><br>The flickering green luminescence in their gaze oscillated between the fist buried in their torso and my figure.<br><br>\- Why?<br><br>"What do you mean, 'why'?"<br><br>\- I-I swore loyalty. I swore on the River of Death...<br><br>"It's too late."<br><br>An alien and cold voice escaped my lips.<br><br>"To undo what you have done."<br><br>Today alone, the death toll is catastrophic.<br><br>Given that the military and hunters, despite their firearms, were overwhelmed, the casualties inflicted by the monster legion this past week are unimaginable.<br><br>"Loyalty is unnecessary. Especially from bastards like you."<br><br>Then I released the Scorching Yang Qi from my dantian.<br><br>Whoosh!<br><br>The Scorching Yang Qi erupted from my fist as I smashed through its ribs, enveloping its entire body with an extremely hot energy.<br><br>Boom!<br><br>The green light of its eyes flickered out like a candle in the wind.<br><br>Simultaneously, the two companions sprung into action, beginning their incantations.<br><br>\- Jazchawa Umbado...!<br><br>\- Bargan Mahra...! \[Note: sigh...I've already changed the source material so much. I feel so icky, I don't want to do it anymore. So here are the raw incantations.\]<br><br>Whoosh.<br><br>A vortex of magic encircled them. As they neared the culmination of their malevolent spell, I interjected nonchalantly.<br><br>"Devour it. All of it."<br><br>Awaiting this command, the Skeleton Warlord emerged, his jaws agape.<br><br>\- Gladly.<br><br>\- Barsaba... Eek!<br><br>\- Noooo!<br><br>They were the last cries of the monsters wishing to survive.<br><br>However, contrary to their wishes, the Skeleton Warlord's suction power was stronger and faster than ever before.<br><br>Swoosh! Gulp!<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord, having ingested an immense surge of death energy, quivered momentarily. Then the two energy-depleted skulls disintegrated into dust.<br><br>Ding. Ding. Ding.<br><br>\- You have successfully completed the sudden quest, \[Unexpected Assault\]!<br><br>\- You have disbanded the monster legion! This is indeed an outstanding achievement!<br><br>\- As a reward for the quest, you have obtained the title, \[Undead Hunter\]!<br><br>\- You have gained a considerable amount of experience and fame!<br><br>\- Level up!<br><br>Just a single level?<br><br>Previously, a feat of this magnitude would have yielded multiple level-ups. It appears, however, that after level 120, the experience requisite has steepened significantly.<br><br>'Getting experience wasn't the goal, though.'<br><br>I did what had to be done, but I can't help feeling a bit disappointed.<br><br>Strengthening my abilities is pivotal for my contribution in impending conflicts.<br><br>'The same goes for that guy.'<br><br>I reflected silently, gazing at the Skeleton Warlord.<br><br>The surge of death energy he's absorbed has exponentially enhanced his might, far surpassing where he was during our first encounter.<br><br>\- Hmm. Hoooooo...<br><br>Black mist billowed out from the ear, eye, and nose holes of the skull.<br><br>The surface boasted a glossy black sheen and a purple glow like a torch. Soon, the Skeleton Warlord's laughter boomed in my head.<br><br>\- Haha, hahahaha!<br><br>"Lower the volume. It's noisy."<br><br>\- You, wicked human. For this time alone, this commander expresses great gratitude to you.<br><br>"Of course, you should. Who else fed you?"<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord bristled at my nonchalant reply.<br><br>\- Fed me? Am I to be considered a pet?<br><br>"Pretty much. Right?"<br><br>\- Stop talking nonsense!<br><br>"Really? Golgol, come back."<br><br>With my hand outstretched, the skull ascended and settled snugly in my grasp.<br><br>I gently scratched its brow as a reward.<br><br>"Good job, Golgol. Oh, how lovely."<br><br>\- ...!<br><br>The skull quivered in response.<br><br>\- How, how can this be! How can this commander be a pet to a mere human!<br><br>"Your mouth says no, but your body is honest."<br><br>\- I am the master of the Black Forest and the great commander of the undead legion. Do not demean me!<br><br>"A commander left with just a head?"<br><br>\- What! Such a body is trivial. If I expend death energy, I can restore it anytime!<br><br>"Really? Then why haven't you restored it until now?"<br><br>\- ...Even if I restore it, some crazy human will just smash it to pieces anyway.<br><br>"Oh, correct answer."<br><br>The luminescence in the Skeleton Warlord's eyes dimmed with indignation.<br><br>\- Why, you wicked human.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>\- There must be a hidden motive for you to feed me, no, to give me such great power. There's definitely a dark intention. Tell me the truth!<br><br>After pondering briefly, I replied.<br><br>"Hmm. Because you're a weakling."<br><br>\- What?<br><br>"You can't beat me anyway. If that's the case, it's more convenient to carry around a stronger and more useful weakling, isn't it?"<br><br>\- ...!<br><br>"Now, go inside. People are coming."<br><br>I quickly stowed the stunned creature in my inventory as I rose to my feet.<br><br>The previously bustling area of airport staff and travelers was now eerily quiet and dim in the duty-free shop corridor, save for three figures approaching.<br><br>And among them, I recognized two.<br><br>"Jin Tae-Kyung."<br><br>「Mr. Jin.」<br><br>Team Leader Choi, surprisingly unscathed, and Shao Shen, an A-rank hunter from China's Public Security Force, approached.<br><br>The aftermath of the battle was still evident on Shao Shen's bloodstreaked and dust-laden face. He appeared weary.<br><br>「You were here?」<br><br>I nodded to Shao Shen.<br><br>"Yes. I had some business to attend to."<br><br>「Please speak casually. Emperor F-, no, Mr. Jin, you are a hero who saved me and my comrades. Furthermore, a hero to the people of China.」<br><br>"......"<br><br>Was I mistaken? It seemed like he almost said "Emperor Fuck" just now.<br><br>Whether he knew what I was thinking or not, Shao Shen proceeded with his address, embodying the epitome of courtesy.<br><br>「Fortunately, thanks to the assistance of the two masters from the Peace Guild, we were able to repel the monsters. I take this opportunity to express our gratitude once again.」<br><br>"Ah, yes. It's nothing much. It was just something that needed to be done."<br><br>I waved my hand dismissively while sneakily glancing at Team Leader Choi.<br><br>I wondered if the \[Integrated Language Pack\] might malfunction and give away something odd. But since I was speaking to Shao Shen, anything I said sounded like Chinese to Team Leader Choi's ears.<br><br>"And who might this person be...?"<br><br>The unfamiliar face among us.<br><br>A middle-aged man, his hair touched by grey, observed our exchange quietly before offering a handshake.<br><br>「I am Wei Feng-Hu, the Minister of National Defense from the Central Military Committee. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Jin.」<br><br>"The Minister of National Defense, you say..."<br><br>「The rank is General.」<br><br>"Ah, I see."<br><br>His significance was apparent, yet the implications of "General" eluded me.<br><br>Noticing my bewilderment, Team Leader Choi leaned in, whispering as softly as possible,<br><br>"Four stars. He has four stars."<br><br>"Ah! So you're a General! Pleased to meet you!"<br><br>I once had four stars myself. There was this game I played as a kid; it was really fun. The sequel was a total flop, though. \[Note: sometimes I wonder if there is something wrong with me that makes me this obsessive about this bloody novel. But anyway, after some time I think I have found the game that he is referring to here. At this point, I'm pretty sure it's "Sudden Attack" based on the context of the current setting being the military and the sequel of this game got shut down within 23 days of its initial release, which I think is qualified to be considered as a flop.\]<br><br>Wei Feng-Hu, the General, offered a restrained smile as we exchanged handshakes.<br><br>「Maybe it's because you're young, but you are very spirited. I have many questions for Mr. Jin... Shall we discuss them on the way?」<br><br>"Sure, why not."<br><br>Just as I prepared to follow Wei Feng-Hu, a moment of hesitation struck me.<br><br>"Where are we going?"<br><br>「To the operations headquarters. We have a jet ready.」<br><br>"A headquarters? A jet?"<br><br>「Yes. Everyone is waiting for you there.」<br><br>Everyone? Who?</p>
