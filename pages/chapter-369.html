                        <p>"Search every nook and cranny. If you slack off like it's just another day of training, you'll deeply regret it."<br><br>"Goodness, Sahyung. Anyone overhearing might think you're serious. You really don't hold back, even with the kids around."<br><br>"You spend every day roaming around drunk... Will you only come to your senses if you're thoroughly beaten?"<br><br>"Alright, alright, I get it."<br><br>Despite his Sahyung's admonitions, Hwang-So, the youthful disciple, struggled to dispel the gloom from his expression.<br><br>He was a member of the Gongdo Sect in Sichuan and had been selected for this quest with around thirty other disciples from the first and second generations.<br><br>'Shit, what mess have we been tangled in for the past five days?'<br><br>Hwang-So silently fumed.<br><br>He hailed from a notably affluent trading family and had felt no wanting or discomfort growing up.<br><br>Thrust onto the martial path by his father's ambition to forge ties with the martial community, his recent experiences of discomfort quickly exhausted his reserves of patience.<br><br>'Phew, I heard the newly arrived courtesan at Dengwang Tower is absolutely stunning...'<br><br>His mind wandered towards his favored courtesan establishment just then.<br><br>"You! Even after what I said, you're still not paying attention!"<br><br>"Ah, got it. I understand."<br><br>Jolted by his Sahyung's sudden outburst, Hwang-So promptly got moving.<br><br>The Sahyung, witnessing this, expressed his disappointment with a click of his tongue.<br><br>"If you don't want to die a horrible death, pull yourself together. You're well aware of our current situation."<br><br>"I know, I know. We're suffering here trying to catch a demon that doesn't even exist."<br><br>"Doesn't exist?"<br><br>"That's right. The Third Monster or whatever. We're searching everywhere for someone who has long since fled."<br><br>The Sahyung's demeanor became stern at Hwang-So's cavalier remarks.<br><br>"Watch your words. Since the Great Faction War, it's the first time the Sichuan Murim have united to cast the Net of Heaven and Earth. Everything happens for a reason." \[Note: as we already know, the major forces of Murim consist of the Nine Great Sects and Five Great Families. These Sects and Families are fairly spread out, except for the Sichuan region. This region holds three major power sources: the Qingcheng Sect, the Emei Sect, and the Tang Family. Because of this densely packed martial arts presence, the Sichuan region can be said to have it's own network of martial artists, or the "Sichuan Murim", consisting of all of the large and small factions within Sichuan itself.\]<br><br>"Who said there wasn't a reason? I'm not deaf. I've heard it all."<br><br>Hwang-So had grown weary of the explanations surrounding their mission.<br><br>Rumors had spread that Dark Heaven, or some such entity, had launched an assault, devastating the Tang Family, Qingcheng Sect, and Emei Sect.<br><br>At the forefront was a formidable demon marking the dawn of a new age, having vanquished the Poison King and the Heaven-Stunning Shinni, leading the fearsome Monstrous Trio of Qilian along with legions of malevolent ghosts. They divided into three factions, laying waste to Sichuan's leading sects in a bloodbath.<br><br>This event, now referred to as the Blood History of the Three Great Sects, was well known to all in Sichuan, including Hwang-So. \[Note: the character for "Sect" in the Blood History of the Three Great Sects can also be translated to "Clan" or "Family", depending on the context. So even though it says "Sect" in the name, it is to be understood to include the Tang Family.\]<br><br>"In the end, didn't we spectacularly defeat them? Except for one, all the leading demons were killed, and the rest of their minions scattered and fled. Isn't that the end of it?"<br><br>"…Sigh."<br><br>Despite his Sahyung's scolding, Hwang-So couldn't hide his dissatisfaction.<br><br>It was akin to reciting scriptures to someone without ears. The disciple seemed oblivious to the luck and sacrifices that underpinned their recent triumph.<br><br>‘The mysterious martial artist who suddenly appeared to save the Qingcheng Sect. The numerous members of the Beggar Sect and nearby martial arts factions who rushed to save the Emei Sect in crisis. And……’<br><br>Had 'they' not intervened, the Tang Family of Sichuan, along with the other two venerable factions, would have vanished from Murim just five days past.<br><br>The Blood History of the Three Great Sects represented an abrupt, vast onslaught that stunned the entire orthodox Murim.<br><br>‘But this so-called martial artist's thoughts are so shallow. Even if he joined out of necessity……’<br><br>Observing his Sahyung's disheartened head shake, irritation flared within Hwang-So.<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>"Enough. Keep quiet and pick ten people to search beyond that hill."<br><br>"Again? We've already searched that place several times over the past five days…"<br><br>"The area we're responsible for should be searched a hundred, a thousand times over if necessary. I'll search the nearby bushes myself, so just follow my instructions without complaining."<br><br>Hwang-So clenched his jaw.<br><br>'I should talk to my father and return home as soon as possible. Why would a demon who fled from the Emei Sect appear here?'<br><br>The net of martial artists, involving thousands of participants, executed its function flawlessly.<br><br>The remnants of Dark Heaven, having retreated following their defeat in the Blood History of the Three Great Sects, were largely eliminated or apprehended.<br><br>Now, only the elusive third member of the Monstrous Trio of Qilian, who had targeted the Emei Sect, remained, with the current search area under the Gongdo Sect's vigilance being close to Sichuan's capital city.<br><br>'Considering the demon's weakened state, why would he walk into the lion's den instead of running to Tibet or Yunnan?'<br><br>Hwang-So's skepticism wasn't unfounded.<br><br>Indeed, why would a demon, now Murim's enemy, risk penetrating the dense net of martial artists to approach the capital?<br><br>'Even if there was a chance that the demon fled here, why are we stationed in this area? The Qingcheng Sect's Taoists are already safeguarding this location.'<br><br>This scenario stemmed from the Sahyung's stubbornness, which transcended principled adherence to becoming exasperatingly inflexible.<br><br>Muttering expletives under his breath, Hwang-So nonchalantly directed the nearby third-generation disciples.<br><br>"You there, with the big nose. Yeah, you, and up to the one with the big ears, ten of you, follow me."<br><br>Compliance was obligatory when commanded.<br><br>Yet beneath his Sahyung's disapproving gaze, Hwang-So entertained frivolous thoughts.<br><br>'Just you wait. Once this ordeal concludes, I'm off to Dengwang Tower for some well-deserved enjoyment.'<br><br>With his heart elsewhere, a proper search was impossible.<br><br>The third-generation disciples, following Hwang-So's lead, performed a cursory scan of the vicinity, oblivious to the faint bloodstains on the foliage.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>'Luckily, only fools are here. With this level of carelessness, there's no need to worry.'<br><br>The Third Monster exhaled a breath of relief and stretched his limbs.<br><br>Swoosh.<br><br>He propelled himself forward rapidly, his feet brushing the foliage.<br><br>Given the caliber of martial artists he had encountered thus far, his presence would likely go unnoticed.<br><br>'The thought of me doubling back towards the capital city never crossed their minds.'<br><br>The satisfaction of outsmarting the righteous factions was fleeting, soon replaced by a surge of fury and a desire for vengeance within the Third Monster.<br><br>'If it weren't for those damned bastards...!'<br><br>The initial phase of the assault five days prior was proceding successfully.<br><br>The demise of the Emei Sect's leader, the Heaven-Stunning Shinni, and the sect elders had created a significant void, which the forces of Dark Heaven exploited ruthlessly under the Third Monster's command.<br><br>And then, amidst the chaos and slaughter, they made their entrance.<br><br>'Hey, you scum worse than dogs!'<br><br>Some beggar brat.<br><br>'Hyuk Mu-Jin, the Vice Leader of the Great Jin Family of Taiyuan's Jin Dragon Squad, and the right hand, or should I say, the left pinky finger of the Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi, Jin Tae-Kyung, has arrived!'<br><br>And a young man, who was either a right hand or a left pinky finger.<br><br>'Everone! I have returned!'<br><br>And lastly, a middle-aged nun who seemed to be a disciple of the Emei Sect. Initially, the Third Monster couldn't believe their audacious appearance.<br><br>'What? Scum worse than dogs? This beggar brat is asking to die. Just wait. I, your elder, will tear your limbs apart and kill...'<br><br>As the Third Monster approached with disdain, he was forced to retract his threats.<br><br>Emerging behind the brave young beggar was an overwhelming flood of additional beggars.<br><br>An actual sea of beggars!<br><br>'B-Beggar Sect?'<br><br>For the Third Monster, this was an unexpectedly rapid mobilization. In less than a day, the Beggar Sect had amassed not just dozens or hundreds, but over a thousand members to defend the Emei Sect.<br><br>'The Hugae commands: Beat them like dogs!'<br><br>'Armor! They're wearing armor!'<br><br>'Aim for the exposed parts! Crush their balls!'<br><br>With a nun from the Emei Sect leading a fearless charge into the fray, and a relentless horde of Beggar Sect members backing her, the tide of battle began to shift.<br><br>The Third Monster and his dark-robed warriors fought valiantly, cutting down their foes, but the momentum of the battle had irreversibly shifted.<br><br>'Brothers of the Beggar Sect! Do not retreat!'<br><br>'Waaaaaah!'<br><br>'Take revenge on this dog-shit bastard!'<br><br>The human wave tactics were utterly disorienting.<br><br>Slay one beggar, and instead of two, five or ten more would surge forward.<br><br>And after exerting every ounce of energy to fell them, what next?<br><br>There was no respite. Out of nowhere, a club would arc through the air, shattering groins, and an iron rod would smash against skulls.<br><br>Dead men have no future.<br><br>'Kuh-huk...!' \[Note: this is meant to be the sound of someone getting choked.\]<br><br>The men clad in black turned to frigid cadavers one by one. The Third Monster found himself too besieged to attend to his followers.<br><br>'Deploy the Seven Divine Nuns!' \[Note: direct translation - Seven Fairies.\]<br><br>The elite of the Emei Sect, the Seven Divine Nuns, ensnared the Third Monster with their united stance.<br><br>Despite grave wounds, they pressed their assault with no regard for their own lives, leaving the Third Monster wearied by mounting stress and exhaustion.<br><br>Recalling the events from five days prior, the Third Monster's face twisted in agony.<br><br>'And then, the Annihilating Shinni. That damned old demoness delivered the final blow.'<br><br>The appearance of the Annihilating Shinni shocked not only the Third Monster but also the disciples of the Emei Sect.<br><br>She was the only Master of the Heaven-Stunning Shinni, and was believed to have died thirty years ago at the age of one hundred.<br><br>Confronted once more by a Transcendent Master, the Third Monster chose immediate flight, his followers dispersing in panic.<br><br>A definitive defeat, yet the Third Monster managed to survive.<br><br>Employing skin-changing techniques and pinpointing the weakest link in the net of martial artists, he navigated to his current location.<br><br>Here he stood, at a deserted cliff, a site untouched by others.<br><br>"Finally... sob!"<br><br>The Third Monster stifled the welling emotions as the cliff's vista drew near.<br><br>Only now did the combined grief and rage from the loss of his brothers engulf him.<br><br>"Don't be too resentful. Even though we retreat for now, I, the youngest, will definitely avenge my brothers."<br><br>Just as the Third Monster solemnly pledged retribution and reached toward the cliff...<br><br>Shiiing!<br><br>Shock widened the Third Monster's eyes. Accompanied by a scalding pain, his wrist was severed, plummeting downward.<br><br>It was a torment he hadn't endured in ages. A scream finally erupted past his clenched teeth.<br><br>"Aaaagh!"<br><br>Simultaneously, a cold dread crept along his spine.<br><br>Swiftly stifling the bleed by applying pressure to his artery, he abruptly raised his gaze.<br><br>Where only cliff had been moments before, now stood a person all too recognizable.<br><br>"B-Big Brother?"<br><br>The Third Monster's exclamation was a blend of happiness and shock. The First Monster, though, remained composed.<br><br>"I'm glad you think so. I was worried about the quality of this skin-changing technique."<br><br>"……!"<br><br>Crack, crunch.<br><br>In the next moment, the First Monster's grotesque face rippled as if made of water. His stooped posture corrected itself, and his limbs grew longer.<br><br>Where once stood an unsightly old man, a youth with an air of nobility now appeared.<br><br>"Wh-who are you?"<br><br>The Third Monster's query was met with a serene smile from the youth.<br><br>"Mun-Kyung."<br><br>The smile on the youth's face deepened.<br><br>"Your nemesis." \[Note: efficiency-wise, I already like this guy better than the Sword Saint. He is very thorough with his killing.\]</p>
