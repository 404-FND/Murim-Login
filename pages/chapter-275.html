                        <p>"You're naive."<br><br>Mr. Choi's words still haunt me.<br><br>Sitting in the caretaker's chair next to the bed, I absentmindedly stare at the humidifier dispersing mist. I spoke my thoughts aloud to the sleeping Mr. Hyuk-Jun:<br><br>"I am not naive."<br><br>The Murim is aptly described as a mountain of swords and a forest of blades.<br><br>Blood and death are daily companions. Power is the only justice, and the last one standing is the victor.<br><br>Whenever I bore witness to Murim's brutality, I found solace in thoughts of the contemporary world.<br><br>A place of welfare and legal order, where people are guided by ethics. Civilization advanced beyond Murim's comprehension.<br><br>But I was wrong.<br><br>"I was not naive. I was just foolish."<br><br>True, martial artists wear their swords with pride, but the modern era hides its weapons more subtly — daggers concealed in fine sleeves.<br><br>Monsters aren't confined to the gates; they roam amidst us.<br><br>Donning pristine suits, radiating virtue, ruling over sprawling metropolises.<br><br>Those who unsheath their concealed weapons are the true beasts beyond the gates.<br><br>Like Won Myung-Hoon.<br><br>I have been too soft-hearted.<br><br>Even knowing that the world is unjust and miserable, I couldn't let go of my optimism.<br><br>This is the modern era. A democratic society of the 21st century. Though there might be fierce competitions to prove one's worth, I thought incidents like today's wouldn't happen.<br><br>'And this is the result.'<br><br>Beside me lay Im Hyuk-Jun, his arms cut beneath the elbows, now restored by masterful healing arts and potent potions.<br><br>He might cope with daily life, but his hunter's future teeters on uncertainty. Potions have their limits.<br><br>'Who did this?'<br><br>Cold thoughts churned within me.<br><br>Who? Why? What drove them to dispatch the Black Hunters?<br><br>Severing Im Hyuk-Jun's arms could serve as a warning, or perhaps a battle cry.<br><br>I will decipher their message.<br><br>And until that moment, I refuse to stand still.<br><br>Nor will Mr. Choi.<br><br>"Rest now, mister."<br><br>Gently, I draped the rumpled blanket over Im Hyuk-Jun.<br><br>Vvvv vvvv<br><br>The stillness of the room was disturbed by the phone's vibrations.<br><br>A brief message from Mr. Choi flashed across the screen.<br><br>\[To the guild house.\]<br><br>Without hesitation, I departed the hospital. As midnight deepened, two figures awaited me at the now-deserted guild house.<br><br>"Good to see you, Mr. Jin Tae-Kyung."<br><br>"Come on in."<br><br>Mr. Choi and Song Song greeted me.<br><br>But Butler Kim, a constant presence like a shadow by Mr. Choi's side, was conspicuously absent.<br><br>Mr. Choi read the query in my eyes.<br><br>"He has stepped out for a moment."<br><br>"Is that so?"<br><br>Though Butler Kim's absence piqued my curiosity, there were more urgent matters to address.<br><br>I got straight to the point.<br><br>"What's this about?"<br><br>"Before I explain, I should probably offer you some coffee... but first, have a look at this."<br><br>Instead of a coffee cup, Mr. Choi handed me his smartphone. The screen showcased the nation's premier news portal.<br><br>A slender finger touched a window, and a cascade of articles divided by categories appeared.<br><br>I quickly scanned the article displayed at the top.<br><br>\[Judiciary Bows to Public Pressure: Is Justice at Stake?\]<br><br>\[A statement from the Unity Party's senior member, Represetnative Yoon Seo-Yoon: "Won Myung-Hoon should have faced the judgment of the law. Instead, he was murdered by an individual's hasty decisions." Backlash ensues...\]<br><br>\[Self-defense or cold-blooded-murder?\]<br><br>These headlines, dripping with political and societal overtones, conspicuously avoided a direct mention, yet it was evident to whom they alluded.<br><br>"When did this go live?"<br><br>"Roughly an hour back. It's garnered over 100,000 views with 5,000-plus comments."<br><br>"All this at four in the morning?"<br><br>"Seems our netizens are rather active, or perhaps those compensated to stir the pot are especially so."<br><br>"How amusing."<br><br>Sipping his cold coffee, Mr. Choi's gaze met mine, his amusement mirroring my own.<br><br>"There's an even more interesting article."<br><br>"More than this?"<br><br>"Scroll down a bit. It'll be more than you're expecting."<br><br>Mr. Choi was right. As I scrolled, my fingers involuntarily stopped.<br><br>Silently, I stared at the bolded article headline.<br><br>\[Exclusive: Former Associate, Mr. K Reveals: "Famous Hunter J is a Truly Reprehensible Man."\]<br><br>Tapping the headline, a 3-minute interview preview began, preceded by a brief cosmetics advertisement.<br><br>Despite the intentional pixelation, the face of the stout man in the suit was unmistakable.<br><br>"Ha."<br><br>The identity of this middle-aged man, or rather 'Former Associate, Mr. K', made me scoff.<br><br>That all-too-familiar face of a person I thought I'd never see again was right there.<br><br>"I never thought I'd see him again."<br><br>Song Song, peeking over my shoulder at the smartphone, asked,<br><br>"Do you really know him?"<br><br>"Know him? How could I not?"<br><br>"If he's giving such a trashy interview, I assume you two weren't on good terms?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"So, were you close?"<br><br>"It's not that..."<br><br>What word would best describe the relationship between that man and me? After pondering for a moment, I spoke.<br><br>"He treated me like shit."<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>No matter how much I thought about it, that phrase was the most fitting.<br><br>Our relationship was terrible. Considering all of our past, it's almost surprising we never came to blows.<br><br>I stared intently at the face that had gotten chubbier since I last saw it.<br><br>'Mr. Sang-Shik. It's been a while.'<br><br>Kim Sang-Shik, once the esteemed team leader of the Picnic Guild.<br><br>During my days as an F-rank Hunter, he had orchestrated my dismissal by inciting the guild leader against me.<br><br>Our paths last crossed at the Association during my rank reassessment. I never imagined our fates would intertwine again.<br><br>'I heard he got fired from the guild afterward.'<br><br>Kim Sang-Shik is a person full of greed yet lacking in capability. Contrary to his name, which translates to "common sense," he had none. He frequently stumbled into pitfalls of his own making.<br><br>It wasn't surprising that such a petty man would harbor resentment.<br><br>His participation in this interview confirmed as much.<br><br>'Let's hear what bullshit he's spouting.'<br><br>Right at that moment, the reporter in the video began to ask a question.<br><br>"We've heard that you have some comments about the recently famous Hunter J. Firstly, is it true you were former colleagues?"<br><br>With an air of exaggerated importance, Kim Sang-Shik nodded.<br><br>"Without a doubt. I was Jin Tae... I mean, J's direct supervisor."<br><br>"Were you?"<br><br>"He was a member of my team. After the gate incident two years ago, I became the team leader. It was also I who informed J of his termination last summer."<br><br>"Really? What was the reason for termination?"<br><br>"There was more than one reason."<br><br>Kim Sang-Shik then passionately listed the reasons for firing me.<br><br>His hyperbolic narrative reached a crescendo of absurdity when he proclaimed,<br><br>"Though I was unfairly framed for employment corruption and got expelled from the guild I served for over 20 years, my firing of J wasn't for any personal gains."<br><br>"You had a different motive then?"<br><br>"Absolutely."<br><br>In this brief preview, with the fervor of a misplaced martyr, Kim Sang-Shik made known his real reason for agreeing to this interview.<br><br>"Two years ago, during the Sangdong gate incident, J threw his teammates to the monsters as bait and ran away. He wouldn't hesitate to do anything despicable and dirty to survive..."<br><br>I didn't hear the rest of what he said.<br><br>After the preview ended with a caption promising a full version of the interview soon, I remained silent, staring at the screen.<br><br>Almost as if I believed that if I stared long enough, Kim Sang-Shik would jump out of it.<br><br>The palpable tension was punctured by Mr. Choi.<br><br>"How do you feel?"<br><br>How do I feel?<br><br>Betrayed, yet amused. A fire of indignation simmered within me.<br><br>"It's quite interesting, just like you said, Team Leader."<br><br>"I laughed when I first saw it too, knowing what kind of person Mr. K, or rather Kim Sang-Shik, is. The problem is..."<br><br>"The public might not find it as amusing."<br><br>"Exactly."<br><br>The comments section was already on the brink of a meltdown.<br><br>I didn't need to wade through the ever-growing sea of comments, which had already swelled past ten thousand. One top comment caught my eye.<br><br>(Top Comment) I knew something like this would happen. I heard rumors from across the bridge and hoped they weren't true, but I always felt it'd blow up someday.<br><br>What bridge are they talking about, and what's blowing up?<br><br>Luckily, I don't have to face whoever posted that in person.<br><br>If they were here, I would've ensured they got their news from the other side of the River Styx next time.<br><br>"I don't think there's any need to see more."<br><br>With a hollow chuckle, I closed the comments section.<br><br>Mr. Choi, retrieving his phone, folded his arms as he said,<br><br>"It's organized. It's now clear that they targeted you from the start by sending the Black Hunters."<br><br>"This public smear campaign must be their handiwork as well."<br><br>"People are like that. Once they start riding a wave, it's hard to regain balance."<br><br>"And amidst all this, not a single news article about the attack on Mr. Hyuk-Jun."<br><br>"You've done your homework."<br><br>"If I hadn't, I'd be an idiot. Did the investigative team handling the case say anything?"<br><br>Mr. Choi slightly shook his head.<br><br>"You can't possibly mean they're in on it?"<br><br>"It seems they're under external pressure too. They're sitting on the CCTV footage."<br><br>"Didn't you say there were witnesses?"<br><br>"All three of them have vanished."<br><br>Fantastic.<br><br>The muffled crackling of bones betrayed my unconscious clenching of fists.<br><br>"This is a full-scale assault."<br><br>"It's a calculated move, targeting you specifically. The interview with Kim Sang-Shik is a testament to that."<br><br>And it wasn't just tabloid fodder pushing the narrative.<br><br>It was orchestrated by one of the nation's leading media outlets.<br><br>"The most absurd bullshit can be well-packaged and made plausible, and in that process, trust can be added through power and money."<br><br>For instance... testimonies from those who claimed to know me best.<br><br>"I guess I'll see the faces of my old colleagues after a long time. Oh, they'll probably be pixelated, so it might be hard to recognize them, right?"<br><br>I posed this to Mr. Choi, who was looking at me with a contemplative gaze.<br><br>"Why do you say that? I remember you had a good reputation within the Picnic Guild."<br><br>"I got along with everyone. It's a rather close-knit guild after all."<br><br>"But why would you think this way now?"<br><br>"This always works, right?"<br><br>I made a circle with my thumb and index finger. \[Note: while this hand sign means 'OK' in most English-speaking countries, in Korea, this sign is also used to mean 'monkey'\]<br><br>It always circles back to money.<br><br>For hunters, who brave death for their earnings, the siren call of it proves irresistible.<br><br>"After back-to-back betrayals, it's hard to trust those with whom I spent the last seven years in laughter and joy."<br><br>Days prior, I would have willingly trusted my old associates.<br><br>But not now. The idealistic realm of dreams, fellowship, and decency has faded.<br><br>"Considering that articles have appeared in political and social sections, it seems they've buttered up some congressman. What's stopping them from manipulating a few low-ranked hunters struggling to make ends meet?"<br><br>Obviously, I'll be the villain, subject to digital scorn. The reputation I painstakingly built will erode, with our guild collapsing in its wake.<br><br>Throughout this, Mr. Choi wore a puzzling expression, but eventually, a grin formed.<br><br>"You've improved. You seem to think like a worldly adult now."<br><br>"Are you taking back what you said yesterday about me being naive?"<br><br>"I'll decide that based on your actions from here on."<br><br>"What do you mean?"<br><br>"You can't just sit idly by and let them walk all over you."<br><br>As he spoke, he pressed his phone's screen. When it connected, a voice answered.<br><br>"I found it. The tail."<br><br>Through the speaker, Butler Kim's low and soft voice echoed.</p>
