                        <p>Mun-Kyung directed his gaze downward.<br><br>He found himself the center of incredulous stares, one of which belonged to a face he vaguely recognized.<br><br>Identifying him was effortless, despite their brief encounter ages ago.<br><br>"It's been a long time, Fire King." \[Note: With this, Mun-Kyung is confirmed to be the Dark Saint, and I'm seeing a pattern emerging. Just like how the MC cursed at and disrespected Jong Richu, he is generally disrespectful of Mun-Kyung as well (not in a malicious way, but he treats Mun-Kyung the same as he treats Hyuk Mu-Jin). If this pattern continues, the next time we see a mysterious young guy that the MC is disrespectful towards and keeps reappearing, we can be 80% sure that it is the Bow Saint. That 80% increases if he uses the Shit Talking Divine Art on them.\]<br><br>Upon his greeting, the pupils of the Fire King, Jeok Cheon-Gang, trembled with excitement.<br><br>"…It really is you."<br><br>Labeled the world's foremost assassin, his presence had evoked both terror and admiration, until he vanished without a trace for decades.<br><br>But now he had been found.<br><br>"Why are you here…?"<br><br>"A lot has happened. So many things. Don't you think?"<br><br>He addressed the elder, casting a meaningful glance towards the Divine Doctor, Dong Bong, before declaring,<br><br>"It's fortunate. I'm not too late."<br><br>The cadence of his voice spread in every direction.<br><br>All-Round Sound Transmission. \[Note: this is the same technique that the Fire King used to warn the Tiger Swordsman not to touch Tae-Kyung in manhwa chapter 128.\]<br><br>As the spectacle of advanced martial prowess was revealed, the elderly doctor sighed deeply.<br><br>"You are late."<br><br>The Divine Doctor continued.<br><br>"But it is too late to turn back the past."<br><br>"What can we do? It is too difficult to pick up water that has already spilled."<br><br>"Do you not regret it?"<br><br>"Regret."<br><br>Hearing his disciple's words, he raised his head and looked towards the heavens.<br><br>The clear blue was a stark contrast to the prevously storm-ridden sky.<br><br>'Is this your will?'<br><br>He mused silently to an almighty power.<br><br>Though no response came, as usual.<br><br>'Such is the curse.'<br><br>Eyes shut tightly, he was besieged by visions of violence and turmoil.<br><br>They were his memories of a life drenched in bloodshed - raised to kill yet loathing the very act.<br><br>In the aftermath of a devastating war that left the continent stained with blood, the elderly assassin decided to lay down his arms and adopt the life of a healer.<br><br>Yet...<br><br>Could this really be the culmination of everything?<br><br>He softly whispered to himself as he reopened his eyes.<br><br>He looked at his delicate, pale hands.<br><br>The Return to Youth he experienced years prior might have altered his destiny, yet the deep-seated stench of blood on his hands remained unchanged.<br><br>"I've lived for over forty years as a doctor. I wanted to die as one."<br><br>His declaration, laden with a powerful resonance, startled the onlookers. The assailants in black reeled back, their very souls seemingly jolted.<br><br>"Why have you come here?"<br><br>The air thickened with murderous intent, causing every strand of hair to bristle. The Unit Vice Leader, petrified as though confronted by a celestial being, responded with a quiver in his voice.<br><br>"If you truly are the Dark Saint, this is not something you should be involved in."<br><br>"Not something to be involved in?"<br><br>With that, he casually tossed aside his travel bag.<br><br>A heavy thud followed, as something tumbled out, rolling to halt at the Unit Vice Leader's feet.<br><br>"Th-this is..."<br><br>Before them lay the severed heads of two individuals, their bulging eyes and distorted expressions strikingly similar.<br><br>As if they were twins born at the same hour on the same day.<br><br>The Unit Vice Leader's eyes were riveted on one in particular.<br><br>"You!"<br><br>Addressing the visibly unnerved Unit Vice Leader, he began,<br><br>"Let me ask just one thing. Was the one at Qingcheng the second or the third of the Monstrous Trio of Qilian?"<br><br>"......!"<br><br>Silence enveloped the Unit Vice Leader as realization dawned.<br><br>The absence of news from Qingcheng, the disappearance of the brothers despite urgent pleas for their return, all became clear.<br><br>Faced with no alternative, the Unit Vice Leader, enlightened by sudden insight, commanded with vigor,<br><br>"Attack at once! Kill th..."<br><br>Whoosh!<br><br>His order abruptly ceased.<br><br>A mere whisper of a breeze brushed against his neck, and before he could react, a silhouette materialized behind him.<br><br>'I-is this truly... the movement of a human?'<br><br>A final question crossed his mind.<br><br>Facing certain demise was he who failed to discern the Ghostly Assassin's Stride, a maneuver executed by the most formidable assassin in history. \[Note: direct translation - Ghost Phantom Killing Step.\]<br><br>Squelch!<br><br>The air was rent with the sound of a gushing blood fountain from the cleaved neck. As the body slumped, a figure advanced, trailed by a breeze tinged with the smell of blood.<br><br>Squeak, squeak, squeak!<br><br>The heads of the onlookers, dressed in black and staring blankly at their leader's demise, were suddenly aloft.<br><br>Before their blood could stain the earth, a swift shadow had already flitted past.<br><br>"It was the life I desperately wanted."<br><br>He spoke softly, his hands reaching out. From his fingertips unfurled slender, elongated tendrils.<br><br>These were strands of Qi, mesmerizing yet lethal.<br><br>"Why have you..."<br><br>Whoosh!<br><br>A swift motion of his fingers through the air, and the Qi cleaved the very atmosphere.<br><br>Its path left a trail of destruction — armors and weapons, limbs and heads, all dispersed in an indiscriminate spray.<br><br>In the stillness of a world ensnared by death and bloodshed, he alone moved unfettered.<br><br>"...roused me from my peace?"<br><br>Burdened with sorrow and wrath, gone was the jubilant youth, and vanished was the healer who bequeathed the title of Divine Doctor to his disciple.<br><br>Before he gained the title of Divine Doctor, before he met the young carpenter drowned in sorrow from the loss of his family to plague, and before he buried his weapon and left Murim.<br><br>"Dark Saint...!" \[Note: nerding out time for the good writing here. These three lines represent the reverse timeline of the Dark Saint's whole life.\]<br><br>A wail, teeming with despair.<br><br>He flung his arms, summoning a gale that transformed into a tempest, swallowing the legion of adversaries in black.<br><br>Kwaah!<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>To the east of the Tang Family's domain in Sichuan stands a lofty hill.<br><br>A vantage point overseeing the Tang estate, marked by a modest watchtower and martial guardians in rotation. Or so it was.<br><br>Drip, drop.<br><br>Blood from the watchtower dripped onto the grass below, some beads trailing down the slope to moisten a hand.<br><br>A hand marked by time and the green hue of nails, the result of years dedicated to mastering poisons.<br><br>It was the hand of Tang Sa-Dok, the Patriarch of the Tang Family of Sichuan, known as the Ten Thousand Poisons Asura. \[Note: I have changed Tang Sa-Dok's moniker slightly. If looking solely at the Korean, the last word in this moniker is "shura", however, if I take into account the Chinese as well, then it's clearly "asura" instead of "shura". This makes sense, as "asura" is an actual word that describes a class of divine beings. So I'm making this change here, but I'll go back to the previous chapters to retroactively change them. Apologies.\]<br><br>"Cough."<br><br>Blood welled up and spilled from his cracked lips. His eyes, once sharp and commanding, now seemed on the brink of extinguishing.<br><br>"Is this the end?"<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok whispered weakly.<br><br>The fall of all he held dear was nearing. His own life and the storied legacy of the Tang Family were converging on an end.<br><br>"The foundation built over hundreds of years... has crumbled overnight."<br><br>His lament was devoid of spirit. He was drained of the capacity for rage or grief.<br><br>The only solace for the gravely wounded, battered Patriarch was to slump against an anonymous tree, witnessing the demise of his lineage.<br><br>'This is my last gift to you.'<br><br>The face of a smiling middle-aged man flashed before Tang Sa-Dok's eyes.<br><br>This man, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, had broken his vow. The obliteration of the Tang Family had been sealed by his hand.<br><br>"Ugh. Cough!"<br><br>An inferno within him reignited, aggravating his wounds further. Expelling blood, Tang Sa-Dok struggled for breath.<br><br>"I'm sorry. So sorry…"<br><br>He offered his apologies to the forebears of the Tang Family, to the family members who lost their lives under his command, and to Jin Tae-Kyung and his companions, presumably now perishing under the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's hand.<br><br>Silence was the only response to Tang Sa-Dok's remorse.<br><br>'When we meet in the Nine Heavens, I'll apologize in person.'<br><br>As Tang Sa-Dok muttered to himself,<br><br>Ssssst.<br><br>The sound of something — or someone — traversing the underbrush drew near.<br><br>But it wasn't a person. Tang Sa-Dok discerned the identity of the visitor only as it drew closer.<br><br>Shriek, shush.<br><br>A serpentine figure with a flickering tongue and crowned by horns, a white snake coiled into his embrace.<br><br>"Ha, haha."<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok's laughter was tinged with both delight and surrender.<br><br>"Was it you?"<br><br>Ssss.<br><br>Mimi, the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent, hissed as if responding to its master. Its cold tongue licked his blood-stained beard.<br><br>"Clever creature, how did you find your way here?"<br><br>With his vision clouding, Tang Sa-Dok gazed affectionately at his serpent companion.<br><br>He had let it go, worrying it might get hurt in the chaos of battle. He never thought they would meet again like this.<br><br>And would part in such a manner.<br><br>Rumble!<br><br>A colossal thunderclap echoed to the hill, upheaving soil and trembling the foliage.<br><br>Straining to pinpoint the disturbance's origin, Tang Sa-Dok's blurred sight offered no clarity.<br><br>Yet one thing was apparent to him.<br><br>'Has the time come?'<br><br>A tumult unlike the Heaven-Shaking Thunder heralded the looming fall of the mighty Tang Family of Sichuan.<br><br>In acceptance, Tang Sa-Dok gently shut his eyes.<br><br>"Leave."<br><br>Ssss?<br><br>The triangular head tilted in confusion.<br><br>"Neither this old man nor the Tang family have much time left. Staying here will only bring you harm."<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok was the Patriarch of the Tang Family of Sichuan. Even if it was not the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, someone would surely come to verify his death.<br><br>And it was easy to guess what those beasts would do upon seeing the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent by its master's side.<br><br>"So go. Hurry!"<br><br>His plea was frail, as if on the verge of breaking.<br><br>Yet Mimi, the faithful companion who had stood by Tang Sa-Dok through years, grasped the urgency of his final request.<br><br>Drip, drop.<br><br>Tears fell onto Tang Sa-Dok's aged hand.<br><br>With a parting sorrow, Mimi, the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent, glided away, its silhouette blending into the distance.<br><br>As solitude enveloped him, Tang Sa-Dok's features were etched with a somber smile.<br><br>"Take care, Mimi."<br><br>In his youth, he roamed the battlefields, and after the war, he dedicated his life to rebuilding the Tang Family of Sichuan with his father, the Poison King.<br><br>Always being cold and meticulous, he had no companion, lover, or child of his own blood to share his heart with.<br><br>Without the presence of this mystical being, the solitude of years would have been unbearable.<br><br>'From today, your name is Mimi. Tang Mimi.'<br><br>Upon their first meeting, Tang Sa-Dok bestowed upon the diminutive serpent the Tang family's surname.<br><br>Despite their different lineages and species, Tang Mimi was embraced as part of the Tang family by its Patriarch.<br><br>'To lose everyone and only save you. Haha.'<br><br>A hollow laugh escaped Tang Sa-Dok as he fought back tears.<br><br>Amidst the fog of fading consciousness, distant sounds of turmoil and a scream from below the hill reverberated faintly.<br><br>It was likely the last stand of those defying their family's downfall.<br><br>'There's still me. I, Tang Sa-Dok, the Patriarch of the great Tang Family of Sichuan, am here! Come to me!'<br><br>This silent battle cry, though fervent, dissolved unvoiced at his lips' edge.<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok sensed his vitality ebbing away, his heavy eyelids inching closer to closure.<br><br>'I'm tired.'<br><br>What if he allowed himself to succumb to this weariness, to drift into profound slumber?<br><br>Perhaps, upon awakening in the great hall, he might greet the familiar faces of his kin.<br><br>How miraculous it would be if all that had transpired, including his father's demise, were merely a Butterfly Dream... \[Note: the Butterfly Dream is a famous philosophical concept from the Chinese Daoist text Zhuangzi, where Zhuangzi dreams he is a butterfly and upon waking, questions whether he is a man who dreamt of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being a man. This story illustrates the theme of transformation and the blurred lines between reality and illusion. It highlights the Daoist perspective on the relativity of existence and the nature of subjective experience.\]<br><br>'Yes, if only that were so.'<br><br>With that, Tang Sa-Dok's eyelids sealed shut.<br><br>Yet, at the moment of closure,<br><br>"Mimi! Lightning Strike!"<br><br>Shriek!<br><br>"...?"<br><br>What? What nonsense is this?<br><br>Confusion jolted Tang Sa-Dok back to awareness.<br><br>His vision cleared, revealing a youth charging towards him and Mimi, the white serpent, darting forth like a bolt.<br><br>"You, who are you?"<br><br>"Wow! I found a wild Grandpa Tang!" \[Note: how is this reference even possible? Did the MC teach Cheong Pung about the art of Pokemon?\]<br><br>Confronted by Cheong Pung's blood-streaked yet beaming countenance, Tang Sa-Dok blinked in astonishment.<br><br>"H-how is this happening? How did you..."<br><br>With bubbling vigor, Cheong Pung exclaimed,<br><br>"Mimi! Whirlwind!"<br><br>Chirp, chirp!<br><br>Had any strength remained within him, Tang Sa-Dok might have unleashed a tirade.<br><br>Only upon realizing their error did Cheong Pung and Mimi offer contrite gestures.<br><br>"Ah, I'm sorry."<br><br>Ssss.<br><br>"......"<br><br>On the brink of death, Tang Sa-Dok looked on in bewilderment at the man and serpent before him, mustering the strength to inquire.<br><br>"My family. What happened to my family?"<br><br>"They're all dead."<br><br>"......!"<br><br>"Ah, not the Tang family members. The dark-clothed men of Dark Heaven."<br><br>You should have said that first!<br><br>At this juncture, overwhelmed by a mix of shock and ire, Cheong Pung's fingers found Tang Sa-Dok's Mingmen Point, and a warmth reminiscent of spring air enveloped him.<br><br>"Cheong Pung! Qi Master!" \[Note: did he mean Pokemon Master?\]<br><br>This bastard, to the very end...<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok yearned to delve deeper, but succumbed to an irresistible drowsiness.<br><br>As he drifted towards slumber, a soothing voice, akin to a spring breeze, murmured close by.<br><br>"It's all over now. Please rest assured and sleep well."<br><br>It was a voice heralding the end of what was perhaps the longest and darkest day.</p>
