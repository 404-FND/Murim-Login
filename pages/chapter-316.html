                        <p>Goong Gi-Bang carefully placed the silver in his pocket and began to speak.<br><br>"Here is some information about the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency."<br><br>"The Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency? Isn't that the one we came across on our way here?"<br><br>"Yes. Although it's now reduced to just Shaanxi Province, it used to be one of the largest escort agencies in the land."<br><br>"The Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency?"<br><br>Memories from two days prior surfaced in my mind.<br><br>Their might was unquestionable for an escort agency. Ju Hwa-Ran, their youthful leader and a formidable swordsman, was famed as one of the Ten Dragons and Phoenixes. Song Il-Seom, another member, surpassed Ju Hwa-Ran in martial prowess.<br><br>'Including that uncle who seems like he could have written Dongui Bogam, that's three top-notch experts.' \[Note: Dongui Bogam, or the Precious Mirror of Eastern Medicine, is a key text in the field of traditional Korean medicine. It was written by the royal physician Heo Jun in the early 17th century. The MC seems to be making a reference to this book based on the name "Heo Jun".\]<br><br>Their strength rivaled that of a mid-tier martial arts sect.<br><br>Yet, their current state was a shadow of their former prominence, once among the top three globally.<br><br>"What exactly happened to make it end up like this?"<br><br>"It all started just after the death of the Escort King."<br><br>"The Escort King? The one I know of?"<br><br>"There's only one Escort King in the world. The one you know, Ju Gong-San, was the previous head of the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency."<br><br>Escort King Ju Gong-San.<br><br>Though unfamiliar with his name, I knew the title well. My own journey in the martial realm had laid a solid foundation of knowledge.<br><br>In the past year, I've been in constant company with the Fire King, Jeok Cheon-Gang.<br><br>He was a living chronicle of our times, often lost in nostalgia.<br><br>'Now that I think about it, my friend, the Escort King, was quite something.'<br><br>'He's not your friend, you know.'<br><br>'Has it been long since you met the Divine Palm of Fire?'<br><br>'Please keep talking. Please.'<br><br>Jeok Cheon-Gang's recounting of the Escort King's exploits that day was nothing short of awe-inspiring.<br><br>'It was during the height of the Great Faction War. At that time, the Demonic Cult had taken control of eight provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and was advancing into the Central Plains with a hundred thousand demonic soldiers at the forefront.'<br><br>'When will you get to the Escort King?'<br><br>'Has it been long since you encountered the Flame-Extinguishing Divine Fist?'<br><br>'Please keep talking. I will listen carefully.'<br><br>'Anyway, the Escort King at that time was just a wandering escort. Of course, he was already called a famous escort due to his exceptional skills and heroic spirit, but with the Demonic Cult sweeping across the land, would the righteous martial artists have paid any attention to that?'<br><br>'Right. Strictly speaking, an escort is more of the merchant class than the martial world.'<br><br>'The Demonic Cult, too, needed financial resources, so instead of oppressing the escort agencies and merchant groups, they chose to co-opt them. Hence, it wasn’t too strange that the Escort King was in Guangdong, a territory of the Demonic Cult, until he met a heavily pregnant woman.'<br><br>'A heavily pregnant woman?'<br><br>'In her womb was the last heir of the Jin Family of Guangdong. The Jin Family had fiercely resisted the Demonic Cult and had already been annihilated.'<br><br>'They must have been discovered by the Demonic Cult quickly.'<br><br>'The Escort King only realized the pregnant woman's origin after encountering the Demonic Cult's pursuit team. If he didn’t hand over the woman, he would have to turn against the Demonic Cult.'<br><br>At that point, with a string of victories, the Demonic Cult had claimed dominion over vast territories.<br><br>Guangdong, far removed from the righteous factions' lands, was a stronghold of the Cult.<br><br>'What do you think the Escort King did?'<br><br>'If he had handed over the woman to the Demonic Cult, he wouldn't have been the Escort King.'<br><br>'Indeed. He flatly refused the Demonic Cult's demand. Because he had already received the escort fee.'<br><br>In a world mired in conflict, a young escort embarked on what could have been his final task.<br><br>He carried an ancient jade hairpin - the Jin Family of Guangdong's payment for his services.<br><br>'It took him two years.'<br><br>Navigating from Guangdong through Jiangxi, Hubei, and finally to Hanam, the stronghold of the Murim Alliance.<br><br>The escort deftly evaded his pursuers, traversing vast distances. His path took him over mountains, across fields, and through rivers.<br><br>Details of his odyssey remained shrouded in mystery, yet one fact stood clear:<br><br>He had accomplished a legendary feat.<br><br>Upon reaching Hanam, the Jin heir was alive and well in his mother's arms, marking the moment Ju Gong-San ascended as the Escort King.<br><br>'The One God said so. He truly deserved to be called a King. No one objected.'<br><br>Jeok Cheon-Gang often recounted tales of the Escort King.<br><br>Even to somene like Jeok Cheon-Gang, the Escort King was an extraordinary figure.<br><br>'I heard that after the end of the Great Faction War, he established an escort agency in his hometown in Shaanxi... I’m not sure what happened after that. Maybe I should visit someday and share a drink.'<br><br>Jeok Cheon-Gang's plans, however, never materialized.<br><br>As Goong Gi-Bang revealed, the Escort King, Ju Gong-San, had departed from this world.<br><br>'The world really is small.'<br><br>To think the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency that I stumbled upon just days ago, was the legacy of that very Escort King...<br><br>Absorbed in thought, I noticed Goong Gi-Bang preparing to speak.<br><br>"Escort King Ju Gong-San passed away not long after due to the internal injuries he sustained during the Great Faction War. It’s a pity."<br><br>"Then who is the current head?"<br><br>"Gentleman Sword Ju Ho-Gun. He’s the only blood relative left by the Escort King and the father of Ju Hwa-Ran."<br><br>"Gentleman Sword, huh? The nickname itself gives off a certain vibe."<br><br>"I haven't met him personally, but… my Master says he's a really good person."<br><br>It's fascinating how a single word can alter the entire perception of a statement.<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang's Master didn't say that Ju Ho-Gun was a good escort, he said that Ju Ho-Gun was a good person.<br><br>'I can smell the naivety.'<br><br>It struck me that Gentleman Sword's nature might have significantly influenced the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency's current plight.<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang, reading my thoughts, affirmed with a nod.<br><br>"Just as you guessed. Since Ju took over the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency, his kind heart and intolerance for injustice have led to several major losses."<br><br>"He was never meant for this line of work."<br><br>"My master once said this: A chivalrous warrior cannot be a merchant."<br><br>It makes sense. The essence of a noble warrior lies in disregarding profit, while a successful merchant prioritizes it above all.<br><br>Though escort agencies straddle the martial and commercial worlds, they ultimately lean more towards commerce.<br><br>'So, a hundred points as a chivalrous warrior, but zero as a merchant?'<br><br>The Escort King's unique fame enabled him to excel in both realms, elevating the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency to its zenith.<br><br>However, following his demise, Ju Ho-Gun, lacking mercantile instincts, floundered.<br><br>"When a famine struck, he would use up all the stored grain and even buy more at a higher price to distribute, take in poor or orphaned children, feed and shelter them..."<br><br>"That sounds like UNICEF."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>"Never mind, go on."<br><br>"Anyway, when more wealth flows out than in, the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency inevitably started to decline. My master tried to advise him several times because of the past connections, but he wouldn't listen. Said it was his policy."<br><br>"Wow."<br><br>An admirable and noble entrepreneur, yet not particularly astute in business.<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang went on, absentmindedly scratching his back.<br><br>"What can you do? Since Ju took over the agency, it's no wonder that it shrank so much in just thirty years."<br><br>"Thirty years? They say a rich person's wealth can last three generations, no matter the hardship they encounter."<br><br>"Perhaps the escort agency could have lasted three generations, if only Ju hadn’t fallen into madness two years ago."<br><br>"What are you talking about? Is the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency facing an era of extreme hardship or something?"<br><br>"Considering all the misfortunes the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency has faced in the past two years, it's fair to say so."<br><br>"They must have had a hard time."<br><br>For a fleeting moment, the image of Ju Hwa-Ran, steadfast and determined, crossed my mind.<br><br>At the time, I had perceived Ju Hwa-Ran as merely intelligent and attractive. Now, I knew she bore a significant burden.<br><br>But then…<br><br>"What did you mean by a fishy smell?"<br><br>His narrative seemed to be leading to a crucial point, but the only off-putting odor present was emanating from him.<br><br>My direct inquiry prompted Cheong Pung and Hyuk Mu-Jin, who had been attentively listening, to chime in.<br><br>"That's right. I don't smell anything either. I want to smell something foul too!"<br><br>"Young Master Goong, when was the last time you brushed your teeth?"<br><br>As the nearly killed and the nearly dead asked in unison, Goong Gi-Bang grimaced.<br><br>"Stop nagging."<br><br>"Just get on with it. And open your mouth only a little. Seriously, when did you last brush your teeth?"<br><br>"About four months ago."<br><br>His lack of hygiene was appalling.<br><br>Under the intensity of my stern gaze, Goong Gi-Bang hurriedly divulged crucial information.<br><br>"So-Southern Edge Sect."<br><br>"Huh? Southern Edge Sect?"<br><br>"According to what our branch in Xi'an found, it seems that Southern Edge Sect was deeply involved in the downfall of the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency."<br><br>"Really, these guys are everywhere."<br><br>Upon hearing "Southern Edge Sect," the foulness seemed to intensify, likely exacerbated by Goong Gi-Bang's wide-open mouth.<br><br>Yet, given my encounters with Southern Edge Sect members, this was more than mere speculation.<br><br>It was likely the truth.<br><br>"They want to swallow the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency whole, something like that?"<br><br>"Swallow whole? Is it tasty?"<br><br>"Young Master Cheong, could you please be quiet?"<br><br>"Yes, my savior!"<br><br>Unfazed, Goong Gi-Bang continued as if such interruptions were commonplace.<br><br>"It's highly likely. Although Southern Edge Sect operates their own escort agencies, they can't compare to the influence that the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency has in Shaanxi. From Southern Edge Sect's perspective, they are like a thorn in the side, along with Mount Hua Sect."<br><br>"So they started crumbling it down gradually two years ago?"<br><br>"Miss Ju Hwa-Ran is certainly a talented individual. But she's too inexperienced. Like her father, her kindness is also a weakness."<br><br>That's bullshit.<br><br>Well... from what I've heard, Ju Hwa-Ran is only twenty-one years old.<br><br>Organizing all she had learned was daunting enough, but applying it in real-world scenarios while helming a major escort agency was an even more formidable challenge for Ju Hwa-Ran.<br><br>'Especially with the Southern Edge Sect meddling from behind.'<br><br>Even though the Southern Edge Sect might be under the Mount Hua Sect,  the Southern Edge Sect's affiliation with the Nine Great Sects lent them significant clout.<br><br>Without the Escort King's leadership, the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency seemed ill-equipped to withstand the Southern Edge Sect's pressure.<br><br>Little by little, it would be nibbled away until it finally collapsed.<br><br>"How widely known is this information?"<br><br>"It’s top-secret intelligence shared by the head of our branch in Xi'an."<br><br>"Top-secret, huh? So even Mount Hua Sect might not know about it?"<br><br>"Well, they might know, or they might not. Even if they do know, they might choose to ignore it."<br><br>"Ignore it? What do you mean?"<br><br>Goong Gi-Bang paused, exhaling deeply before responding.<br><br>"Because they’re all part of the Nine Great Sects."<br><br>"…What?"<br><br>"Baek Mu-Seong of the First Crane of Mount Hua is a man of integrity. Sword Saint Mae Jong-Hak and Cheong Pung here are clear as a stream. But remember, it’s foolish to judge everything based on one aspect."<br><br>His statement resonated with me.<br><br>After all, I was merely a transient figure in this narrative, planning to discreetly pass this intelligence to Baek Mu-Seong.<br><br>Because he’s a good person I know. And he was the future leader of the Mount Hua Sect.<br><br>But I was wrong.<br><br>'The future is just the future, not the present.'<br><br>Once more, the complexity of the martial world dawned on me.<br><br>Even in the ostensibly straightforward realm of swordsmanship, intricate norms and hierarchies prevail.<br><br>'The arm can only bend inward, is that it?' \[Note: this is a Korean idiom that describes a situation where people are inclined to show favoritism or bias towards their own interests, family, group, or people they are close to instead of reaching out to help others.\]<br><br>Lost in thought, I noticed Goong Gi-Bang's inquiring gaze.<br><br>"What are you going to do?"<br><br>"What can I do?"<br><br>"Are you thinking of… stepping in yourself?"<br><br>"Me?"<br><br>I pondered for a moment but then shook my head.<br><br>My encounter with the Dragon Phoenix Escort Agency was just a fleeting coincidence. I have my own tasks to accomplish.<br><br>"If I happen to meet them before I leave, I might give them a hint. But that’s as far as it goes."<br><br>With Jeok Cheon-Gang down, getting entangled with the Southern Edge Sect would complicate matters.<br><br>For some reason, the face of Ju Hwa-Ran suddenly popped into my mind, and I shook my head to dismiss the thought.</p>
