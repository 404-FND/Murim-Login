                        <p>For the first time, Shao Shen truly understood.<br><br>Kwaaaaaa!<br><br>The sight of an airplane, its wings ablaze, plummeting towards the earth, instills a primal fear across species boundaries.<br><br>\- Uuuuuugh!<br><br>Even the ogres and trolls, creatures of notorious brutality, shrieked in horror.<br><br>\- Gwaaaaaagh!<br><br>The ghoul, known for its sluggish pace among the undead, propelled itself forward as if its life depended on it.<br><br>\- Chiiiiiik!<br><br>「Uh, uh uh, uh uh uh....」<br><br>The capability to vocalize fear was a fortune not granted to all.<br><br>Many, Shao Shen included, found themselves petrified, mere spectators to the impending doom.<br><br>'I need to run away....'<br><br>But his limbs refused to comply.<br><br>Shao Shen and the Public Security Force hunters, encircled by the fray, found escape an elusive dream.<br><br>'Is this the end?'<br><br>This thought haunted the minds of everyone present.<br><br>Googooogooogooong!<br><br>A roar, loud enough to induce ringing in the ears, accompanied the plane's vast bulk as it barreled through the battlefield.<br><br>The catastrophic impact commenced at the monster horde's rear, scattering them in a panic.<br><br>Crunch! Squelch!<br><br>Dozens of tons of metal tore through the battlefield, crushing everything in its path.<br><br>Monster blood, a vivid green, jetted skyward while assorted limbs were flung far and wide.<br><br>‘What on earth is this…’<br><br>The monsters' formidable defenses proved futile. The airplane, now a devastating whirlwind of destruction, spared nothing in its path.<br><br>\- Aaah…!<br><br>\- Screeeech!<br><br>Crunch crunch crunch!<br><br>The sound of flesh being mercilessly ripped apart drowned out the monsters' cries in this unprecedented carnage.<br><br>While Shao Shen and the hunters watched in shock, a wild cry cut through the mayhem.<br><br>"Watch out, there are monsters! Smash them! Kill them!"<br><br>"……!"<br><br>Amidst the chaos, the familiar language reached the Public Security Force hunters, sparking hope of reinforcements. Shao Shen was taken aback.<br><br>‘Such a powerful being!’<br><br>The voice, laden with potent Mana, undoubtedly belonged to an S-rank hunter.<br><br>"Good job, airplane! Let's go!"<br><br>"……."<br><br>Clearly, this was a somewhat unhinged S-rank hunter.<br><br>They had resorted to a tactic reminiscent of World War II kamikaze strategies, without concern for ally casualties.<br><br>'Could this be a directive from the Central Military Commission...? Do we even possess such an S-rank hunter?'<br><br>A fleeting doubt, quickly overshadowed by more pressing dangers.<br><br>The behemoth of steel, having decimated monsters across the battlefield, bore down on them.<br><br>\- Squeak, squeak!<br><br>「Run away!」<br><br>In the struggle to survive, there was no distinction between friend and foe.<br><br>Shao Shen, disregarding the humans before him, lunged with his dagger at an oncoming monster.<br><br>Thump!<br><br>\- Gurgle.<br><br>The lifeless monster collapsed towards Shao Shen.<br><br>Trapped, with monsters closing in from every direction, Shao Shen felt the dead weight topple onto him and yelled.<br><br>「The battle is not over! Fight till the end!」<br><br>Indeed, the fight was far from over. A hunter's duty was to slay monsters until their final breath.<br><br>Inspired by Shao Shen's command, the hunters clenched their jaws and brandished their weapons anew.<br><br>‘This is it.’<br><br>Shao Shen, with remarkable agility, plunged a dagger into the skull of an ogre attempting to flee.<br><br>Taking a moment to catch his breath, he then noticed the imposing bulk of the airplane a mere twenty meters ahead.<br><br>Its velocity had reduced, yet in his immobilized state, dodging it appeared impossible.<br><br>‘I have no regrets.’<br><br>If he died while fighting for his people as a proud hunter of China, that was enough.<br><br>As Shao Shen braced for the end amidst the cacophony of screams,<br><br>"Euscha." \[Note: this is a sound that Koreans make when they lift something heavy. This sound uses Korean characters, which explains why Shao Shen was confused as to what this means. It's kind of like "heave ho" in English.\]<br><br>Crunch crunch crunch! Splash!<br><br>Drenched in what he assumed was blood, Shao Shen puzzled over the sound.<br><br>‘...Euscha?’<br><br>Isn’t the customary cry “Aaargh”?<br><br>The unexpected sound prompted Shao Shen to hesitantly open his eyes.<br><br>There, a short distance away, the plane had come to a standstill, with two men engaged in a nonchalant exchange.<br><br>"We made it. We should quickly get off in case it explodes."<br><br>"……Jin Tae-Kyung. Everyone has fainted."<br><br>"Really? How weak."<br><br>"……They would have died if it weren’t for the barrier magic."<br><br>"Then, Team Leader Choi, please carry them. Oh, right. Is that bastard who called us bangzi earlier still alive?"<br><br>"Yes. He is alive."<br><br>"Then please take good care of that bastard. We’ll have a good time teasing him later."<br><br>"……I’ll try my best."<br><br>Shao Shen was at a loss, unable to piece together the unfolding events.<br><br>Who, when, where, what, how. Why. It was a bizarre spectacle that couldn’t be explained even with the five Ws and one H.<br><br>‘How did the plane suddenly stop, and who are these people? Are they not hunters sent by the Central Military Commission?’<br><br>The two men weren't even speaking Chinese.<br><br>He couldn’t understand the words of the man who looked as noble as a prince, but he knew the language.<br><br>It was unmistakably Korean.<br><br>‘Wait. If he’s Korean…!’<br><br>Swiftly clearing the blood from his eyes, Shao Shen then recognized one of the figures.<br><br>A young man, towering a full head above the rest.<br><br>The figure he had admired on television was now standing before him in the flesh.<br><br>「Excuse me, are you Mr. Jin from Korea?」\[Note: the raw Korean used here is "Jin seonsaengnim", which can be translated in many different ways in English. It is an honorific mostly used for teachers, but can also be given to someone more skilled than you or any type of expert in their field. This is the Korean equivalent to "sensei". There is not really a good English word to use since English doesn't use honorifics, so my compromise here is to use "Mr." since that is typically how U.S. gradeschool students address their teachers.\]<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>Jin Tae-Kyung, the mentioned young man, regarded Shao Shen with a look of confusion.<br><br>"I'm not a teacher, though."<br><br>「Then, are you Emperor...Fuck?」<br><br>"…Fuck? What?"<br><br>Yes, it is him!<br><br>A wave of relief and hope washed over Shao Shen, calming his nerves.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>'How does a Chinese person know about Emperor Fuck?'<br><br>There had been a buzz in foreign news about me, but I had no idea that the nickname Emperor Fuck had spread so far.<br><br>Emperor Fuck, making waves across the five oceans and six continents.<br><br>I wonder if, when I go to America, buff Yankee dudes will come up with a beer bottle, pretending to know me.<br><br>'Hey, yu. Fuck?'<br><br>Ahm pine, dangyuda... Fuck. Who concocted these nicknames? \[Note: the previous line and the beginning of this line are the MC trying to speak English, but it's very broken and with a thick accent. Also, I heard from a foreign friend a while back that when English is taught in his country, the first two phrases that every kid is taught and every dialogue always starts with "Hi, how are you?" and "I'm fine, thank you. And you?" So it is often a running joke for people over there that whether or not a person can speak English, they at least know those two phrases. It seems to be the case for the MC as well.\]<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>"This is bullshit."<br><br>That was my immediate reaction upon surveying our surroundings.<br><br>Team Leader Choi, who had efficiently secured the unconscious as if they were dried fish, alongside the Skeleton Warlord tucked away in my inventory, offered their observations.<br><br>"It's a horrific sight."<br><br>\- Oh, wicked human, this commander finds this place to his liking. It feels both familiar and comforting.<br><br>"……."<br><br>With a named undead expressing satisfaction, further comment seemed redundant.<br><br>"We were thrown into actual combat as soon as we arrived."<br><br>My complaint was punctuated by an alert from the system.<br><br>Ding.<br><br>\- A sudden quest, \[Unexpected Assault\], has been generated.<br><br>This explains the generous compensation. I mused silently before responding.<br><br>"Team Leader Choi, prioritize protecting the civilians first, then handle the fight as you see fit. Don't overdo it."<br><br>"Yes. That was the plan."<br><br>Team Leader Choi possesses not only intelligence but has also significantly enhanced his strength through the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique. I know he won't show off in this situation.<br><br>"And you, the young man there."<br><br>「Y-yes. Mr. Jin.」<br><br>What Mr. Jin? My gaze quickly swept over the young man, assessing him from head to toe.<br><br>His youthful appearance belied his status as a hunter, likely an A-rank given his aura. In contrast to his peers in uniform armors, his attire was marked by a distinctive red banner on his shoulder.<br><br>"It looks like you hold a significant rank, so take good care of your subordinates. Let's save as many people as we can."<br><br>「Y-yes?」<br><br>"The action starts now."<br><br>Launching my fist forward,<br><br>Boom!<br><br>A surge of Scorching Yang Qi erupted, targeting the bewildered monsters.<br><br>The wave of heat annihilated the monsters in its path, leaving a trail of corpses.<br><br>"What are you staring at? Did someone hit the pause button?"<br><br>"……!"<br><br>\- ……!<br><br>Upon my cue,<br><br>The heavy silence that once dominated the battlefield broke into chaos.<br><br>\- Roarrrr!<br><br>「K-kill them! Block those monster bastards!」<br><br>The field became a frenzied mix of humans and monsters, embroiled in a fight for survival.<br><br>I tugged on White Flames, which was firmly planted into the ground, and swung it.<br><br>Swoosh!<br><br>The battlefield in front of me was overrun with monsters, with no humans in sight.<br><br>A crescent force burst forth from White Flames, slicing through the monsters in its path.<br><br>Ding.<br><br>\- \[Lv.15 Undead Goblin\] has been slain!<br><br>\- \[Lv.78 Undead Lycanthrope\] has been slain!<br><br>\- \[Lv.93 Dullahan\] has been slain!<br><br>\- \[Lv.30 Skeleton\] has been slain!<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>\- The level difference is significant. You have earned minimal experience points!<br><br>System notifications detailing monster defeats and experience acquisitions kept sounding off.<br><br>Usually, such alerts would be overlooked or given scant attention.<br><br>However, this time, they served as a crucial clue.<br><br>"Could these creatures be..."<br><br>\- Ah, yes. Oh vile human! Such a formidable undead legion!<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord's cry, brimming with enthusiasm, confirmed my suspicions.<br><br>'Something felt off.'<br><br>The absence of any life force from them had been puzzling.<br><br>Despite a sizeable presence of living monsters, a majority appeared undead, amassing a force nearly two thousand strong.<br><br>"And undead monsters are..."<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord exclaimed with fervor.<br><br>\- Beautiful! Magnificent! Valiant!<br><br>Swoosh!<br><br>As I dispatched five more monsters, I pondered aloud.<br><br>"Do you want to perish like that guy? Beautifully, magnificently, valiantly?"<br><br>\- ...I misspoke. My apologies, oh vile human.<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord hastily corrected himself, momentarily losing sight of his predicament.<br><br>\- Wait. Then, they must be under someone's control!<br><br>That thought had crossed my mind as well.<br><br>Yet, one piece of the puzzle remained elusive...<br><br>"The Lich. Could it be that creature itself?"<br><br>\- Hmm. If you're referring to the Lich from that hologram video you showed me, it's probably not.<br><br>I advanced, heeding the Skeleton Warlord's insight.<br><br>Bang!<br><br>An enormous club whizzed past my shoulder, obliterating the earth where it landed. It belonged to a living ogre.<br><br>\- Grrr…!<br><br>“Time for a barbecue.”<br><br>Boom!<br><br>Struck directly in the chest by the Divine Palm of Fire, the ogre exploded, releasing a torrent of blackish-green blood.<br><br>I continued forward, slicing through the air with White Flames as the ogre's body collapsed.<br><br>Shhh! Swoosh!<br><br>The very fabric of space seemed to split, bisecting the monsters caught in the path.<br><br>Leaving behind the blood-soaked Chinese hunter, who watched in shock, I readied another strike.<br><br>Grrrrr.<br><br>Energy, supercharged and crackling, gathered in my fist before being propelled outward.<br><br>Boom!<br><br>Flame-Extinguishing Divine Fist.<br><br>A towering inferno consumed the monsters.<br><br>The air was thick with the stench of charred flesh, while the survivors shrieked in torment.<br><br>The spectacle of such power momentarily distracted all, friend and foe alike, from the conflict at hand.<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord's voice quivered.<br><br>\- Oh, vile human. You have become even more of a monster.<br><br>“Don't you think it's strange that a monster is calling me a monster? Also, if it’s not the Lich causing this chaos, then who could it be?”<br><br>\- Well, this commander doesn’t know either. But one thing I can assure you.<br><br>“Assure? What?”<br><br>\- That creature’s control over the undead is inferior to mine. Hahaha! My legion! How I miss you!<br><br>“……”<br><br>Do I kill this bastard?<br><br>The thought paused as another query emerged.<br><br>“Hey, what did you just say?”<br><br>\- Hahahat! Have you felt the majesty of this commander, oh vile human?<br><br>“Do you want to be obliterated, or will you speak?”<br><br>\- ……I’ll speak. But what are you asking about?<br><br>“The control over the undead thing.”<br><br>\- Isn’t that obvious? I am the Skeleton Warlord. Compared to those creatures, naturally… Oh?<br><br>A moment of quiet reflection.<br><br>It seemed we were both considering the same possibility. With a gulp, I ventured the suggestion.<br><br>"Try it."<br><br>\- …….<br><br>"Do it, or do you prefer to be obliterated?"<br><br>The Skeleton Warlord, with a hint of reluctance, complied.<br><br>\- Arise, my skeletal warriors...<br><br>Instantly, the undead engaged in the melee froze in their tracks.<br><br>'...It actually worked.'</p>
