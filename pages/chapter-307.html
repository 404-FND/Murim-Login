                        <p>"The world seems new to me now."<br><br>These words marked the Mad Doctor of Luoyang's first utterance after regaining consciousness an hour later.<br><br>Prior to this awakening, he was an elderly figure marked by a notorious irascibility. Yet, in this moment, his voice carried an unanticipated gentleness.<br><br>"Are, are you alright?"<br><br>"Of course, I'm fine. My head hurts a bit, but that's to be expected."<br><br>His newfound demeanor was unsettling.<br><br>One had to wonder about the volatility of a man openly labeled as the 'Mad Doctor'.<br><br>His transformation was stark, akin to the shattering of a clay pot, revealing a wholly different persona.<br><br>Even Sword Saint Mae Jong-Hak, who had hastened to the scene, fearing an assault by dark forces, inquired with a tone of concern.<br><br>"Look here, Mad Doctor. Are you really alright?"<br><br>The Mad Doctor of Luoyang nodded with a faint smile.<br><br>"Haha, Mae Jong-Hak. You don’t need to worry about this old man. Just make sure that this promising young man is carefully looked after so he doesn’t get hurt in the upcoming war."<br><br>"You…!"<br><br>"Sir…!"<br><br>Here stood the illustrious doctor of Henan, a true healer!<br><br>I had once complained to Mae Jong-Hak about this remarkable man, dismissing him as a charlatan.<br><br>Embarrassment and awe overwhelmed me as I bowed, listening to the Mad Doctor of Luoyang.<br><br>"If this young man gets seriously hurt and I end up treating him, I might just shove this acupuncture needle into a lethal point. Haha."<br><br>"……"<br><br>"……"<br><br>"And a physician should never commit murder."<br><br>His cryptic warning was clear: avoid injury at all costs.<br><br>A shiver ran down my spine as I looked up. The Mad Doctor of Luoyang, now resembling a benevolent neighbor, met my eyes.<br><br>"Disciple of Sir Jeok Cheon-Gang or not, his gaze says it all. Haha."<br><br>"……"<br><br>At this rate, he's not the friendly old man next door, but more like a next-door murderer.<br><br>Wrapped in bandages and cackling like a lunatic, the Mad Doctor of Luoyang resumed treating Jeok Cheon-Gang, a task he had earlier deferred.<br><br>Despite his erratic nature, he stood as Henan's most celebrated physician and one of the leading medical authorities in the world.<br><br>Yet, his diagnosis after half an hour mirrored his previous conclusions.<br><br>"I'm not sure. This is truly a mysterious case."<br><br>"Is there… no way to cure it?"<br><br>"No way to cure it?"<br><br>The Mad Doctor of Luoyang's eyes narrowed in annoyance as he addressed me.<br><br>"There is no such thing as an incurable disease in this world. But how can one find a cure without knowing the disease?"<br><br>This realization was a heavy blow.<br><br>If only the disease's name were known, a solution might be within reach. It suggested an unknown malady.<br><br>I clasped Jeok Cheon-Gang's aged hand tightly.<br><br>'Why can't such a strong person stand up?'<br><br>Is it the weight of grief from the death of his disciple followed briefly by his closest friend's demise?<br><br>No, the Jeok Cheon-Gang I know possesses greater fortitude.<br><br>So then...<br><br>'Is it the aftereffect of The Ghostly Dance of the Fire God? Or did the Blood Lord, that guy, play some trick?'<br><br>The Ghostly Dance of the Fire God, a technique that consumes the user's life force, would have been a heavy burden for an elderly Jeok Cheon-Gang.<br><br>Yet, it wouldn't be far-fetched to suspect the Blood Lord, an infamous figure within the dark forces, of foul play.<br><br>The Mad Doctor of Luoyang muttered.<br><br>"It's not a demonic energy, nor is it poisoning. But if it continues like this, the meridians will slowly become blocked."<br><br>Both Mae Jong-Hak and I reacted with shock.<br><br>"What? What does that mean...?"<br><br>"Mad Doctor, you said it wouldn't endanger his life, didn’t you?"<br><br>"You didn't listen to my words properly. I clearly said 'there is no danger for now.'"<br><br>The Mad Doctor of Luoyang hesitantly continued.<br><br>"Feeling his pulse today, I noticed it is different from yesterday. If Jeok Cheon-Gang remains in this state and doesn’t wake up, all his meridians will be blocked, and he will become nothing more than a common villager."<br><br>"Are you saying he will only regain consciousness after losing his martial arts?"<br><br>I asked, dreading the answer. The Mad Doctor shook his head.<br><br>"I can't even guarantee that. Even if heaven helps and Jeok Cheon-Gang wakes up, how much longer can a body that has already lived beyond its natural lifespan endure?"<br><br>"…!"<br><br>The impact of his words was like a hammer blow to my head.<br><br>As the Mad Doctor had stated, Jeok Cheon-Gang was well past a century in age.<br><br>Perhaps the Fire King could endure a decade or two more, but that would only be feasible with robust internal energy and martial arts prowess.<br><br>Confronted with the reality of Jeok Cheon-Gang not as the Fire King but merely an aged man, the pressing question was his remaining lifespan.<br><br>"Half a year. If you continue to stimulate the life-sustaining acupuncture points, you might extend it by a couple of months, but that's it."<br><br>"Half a year... Is there really no other way?"<br><br>"You stubborn bastard. Do you feel satisfied only after making an old man repeat himself twice?"<br><br>Given the mysterious nature of the ailment, a remedy remained elusive.<br><br>The Mad Doctor of Luoyang's definitive response quashed any flicker of hope.<br><br>Yet it was he who rekindled it.<br><br>"That's why you must find the Divine Doctor."<br><br>"The Divine Doctor?"<br><br>It was as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over me, jolting me awake.<br><br>"Who is the Divine Doctor?"<br><br>The Mad Doctor of Luoyang regarded me with a perplexed expression.<br><br>"...You don't know the Divine Doctor?"<br><br>"A physician, right? Supposedly very skilled."<br><br>"Of course, it's obvious from the title 'Divine Doctor'! Even the stray dogs in the back alleys know that. Mae Jong-Hak, is this guy really a martial artist?"<br><br>Mae Jong-Hak stepped forward as the Mad Doctor of Luoyang's temper flared.<br><br>"Calm down, Mad Doctor."<br><br>"How can anyone, even an outsider, not know the Divine Doctor? Is that even possible?"<br><br>"Hmm, must be a famous person then."<br><br>"…What?"<br><br>"…Huh?"<br><br>Both the Mad Doctor of Luoyang and I snapped our heads around, taken aback. Mae Jong-Hak wore an innocent smile.<br><br>'Where have I seen that smile before?'<br><br>Ah, now I remember.<br><br>With a smile resembling that of Cheong Pung, Mae Jong-Hak opened his mouth.<br><br>"I secluded myself in the deep mountains for nearly thirty years, haha."<br><br>"What are you talking about? The Divine Doctor has been known in the martial world for over forty years."<br><br>Following a pause, Mae Jong-Hak's response to the Mad Doctor of Luoyang’s factual volley was delayed.<br><br>"Come to think of it, the old man is over forty years old. It’s been so long, I must have been mistaken."<br><br>"……"<br><br>"……"<br><br>This situation is dire.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>The Divine Doctor.<br><br>As the name implies, had attained an almost celestial proficiency in medicine.<br><br>Around forty years prior, he emerged on the outskirts of the continent, performing miraculous healings and curbing epidemics, thereby earning his moniker 'Divine Doctor.'<br><br>"Since then, the Divine Doctor has generously offered his medical skills. He never turned away any patient and accepted no payment. He was a true physician with a character as noble as his medical skills."<br><br>"Wow, a virtuous physician."<br><br>"Though the world's powerful sought to make him their guest, he would disappear each time, saying he would serve the sick in the lowest places."<br><br>"Wow, the righteous hero Hong Gildong." \[Note: Hong Gildong is a famous fictional character from Korean classical literature. He is akin to a Robin Hood figure. Hong Gildong is known for his agility, cleverness, and ability to appear and disappear swiftly.\]<br><br>"Always covering his face with a white veil, no one has ever seen his face..."<br><br>"Wow, the masked physician."<br><br>Interrupted, the Mad Doctor of Luoyang grasped a large acupuncture needle.<br><br>"Open your trap."<br><br>"I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself."<br><br>"With Mae Jong-Hak here, this young one can't keep his mouth shut, can he?"<br><br>Mae Jong-Hak's eyes shone with a childlike wonder.<br><br>"Wow, the Divine Doctor."<br><br>"……"<br><br>The Mad Doctor of Luoyang, now with only half his wits, briefly yet kindly elucidated further on the Divine Doctor.<br><br>Recognized as the world's finest physician and a person of high moral standing.<br><br>And yet...<br><br>"Nobody knows his identity?"<br><br>"Didn't I say he always wears a veil when practicing medicine?"<br><br>"But he's been active for over forty years, isn’t it odd that no one knows?"<br><br>One would think even a fleeting breeze might have once unveiled him.<br><br>But the Mad Doctor of Luoyang dismissed this notion.<br><br>"Someone might know. However, no one in the world has accurately identified him."<br><br>"Why? Because he always runs away before being found?"<br><br>"The testimonies are always different. Some commoners say the virtuous hero is an old man with white hair, others say a shaven-headed nun. No matter how much people who have seen him are persuaded or comforted, their stories are always inconsistent. How could anyone find him?"<br><br>"Huh."<br><br>"The Divine Doctor's reputation among the people is absolute. With so many volunteering as his eyes and ears, hiding his identity, even the imperial palace gave up on finding him."<br><br>"I get that this Divine Doctor is remarkable, but..."<br><br>Gazing at the Mad Doctor of Luoyang, whose smile radiated self-satisfaction, I voiced my skepticism.<br><br>"How am I supposed to find someone who even the imperial palace has given up on?"<br><br>"Ah, right."<br><br>"……"<br><br>Is this a joke?<br><br>As skepticism furrowed my brow, the Mad Doctor of Luoyang erupted into a robust laugh.<br><br>"Don't worry. Would I have mentioned this to you without any leads?"<br><br>"Of course. I have always had firm faith in you."<br><br>"Ten years ago, after hearing about the Divine Doctor, I was so impressed that I embarked on a journey of practicing medicine."<br><br>"Ah, a medical journey."<br><br>This reminded me of a tidbit I overheard in Taiyuan. Similar to martial artists undertaking pilgrimages to refine their skills, physicians, too, partake in medical journeys.<br><br>Pursuing the trail blazed by the Divine Doctor, the Mad Doctor of Luoyang traversed the continent, venturing into its most secluded corners, dedicating five years to this pursuit.<br><br>"It was a rewarding and joyous endeavor. But for me, who had already passed sixty, it was a challenging journey."<br><br>However, it paid off in the end.<br><br>"Something I had only imagined happened."<br><br>This momentous event unfolded in a slash-and-burn village in the continent's southern reaches.<br><br>The destitute villagers, barely subsisting, spoke of a benevolent soul who had alleviated an epidemic and departed months earlier.<br><br>'You have no place to get treatment here. I will leave some silver coins, use them to recuperate.'<br><br>'Umm…'<br><br>'What is it? Sorry, but that's all the wealth I have left...'<br><br>'Not that. By any chance, are you a physician from Luoyang?'<br><br>'Why do you ask that?'<br><br>'A noble person who treated our sickness a while ago said that. If a physician with the last name Oh from Luoyang comes, pass this to them.'<br><br>The item they handed over was a porcelain shard of a jade-like hue, now in the possession of the Mad Doctor of Luoyang.<br><br>"This is..."<br><br>"Read what's written on it."<br><br>On the porcelain piece cradled in his aged hand, a delicate script was barely discernible.<br><br>"Wu Bei Zi is best when it comes from Sichuan land." \[Note: also sometimes known as Chinese sumac or nutgall tree.\]<br><br>I was baffled by this phrase. The Mad Doctor of Luoyang offered an explanation.<br><br>"Wu Bei Zi is a type of widely used medicinal herb. With this single line, the Divine Doctor subtly hinted to me that he is in Sichuan."<br><br>"…Is that how it works?"<br><br>"That's what I'm saying."<br><br>"So, if I say 'the best adult videos are from Japan', does that mean I'm in Japan?"<br><br>"What kind of nonsense is that? Mae Jong-Hak, is this child completely insane?"<br><br>Mae Jong-Hak, brimming with curiosity, inquired.<br><br>"What exactly is an adult video?"<br><br>"That's not important right now!"<br><br>Exasperated, the Mad Doctor of Luoyang placed the porcelain fragment in my hand.<br><br>"Look properly! Don't you feel it? The Divine Doctor's earnest desire to exchange medical knowledge with me!"<br><br>"His earnest desire, what are you talking about..."<br><br>It was in that instant, as I scrutinized the shard more closely, that something extraordinary occurred.<br><br>Ding.<br><br>\- Quest Item, \[Trace of the Divine Doctor\] acquired!<br><br>\- \[Trace of the Divine Doctor\] can be used to deduce his whereabouts!<br><br>\- Quest, \[Finding the Divine Doctor in Sichuan\] initiated!<br><br>I spoke softly to the Mad Doctor of Luoyang.<br><br>"I do feel it."<br><br>And I see it.<br><br>The way to cure Jeok Cheon-Gang.</p>
