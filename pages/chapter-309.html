                        <p>Three days had passed since my departure from Luoyang, along with the Bermuda Triangle bastards.<br><br>Abruptly, I broke the silence.<br><br>“Mu-Jin.”<br><br>“Huff, huff. Yes?”<br><br>Hyuk Mu-Jin, sprawled on a nearby rock, gasped for air.<br><br>His progress over the past year was commendable, yet his physical and martial prowess had hit a ceiling.<br><br>‘Goong Gibang, is also following well, but still lacking.’<br><br>Goong Gibang, befitting of his status as a successor in his faction, possessed one of the top five skills in the world. However, he fell short of matching Cheong Pung and me.<br><br>What's the use of mastering the most powerful technique of his faction, the 18 Subduing Dragon Palms, if he only reaches 5th mastery?<br><br>“Goong Gibang.”<br><br>“Huh, why did you call?”<br><br>He panted heavily.<br><br>Though slightly better off than Hyuk Mu-Jin, he was clearly taxed.<br><br>And then there was the last of us...<br><br>“Savior, would you like some dumplings?”<br><br>“You go ahead and eat them.”<br><br>“I ate a lot on the way here. I'm full.”<br><br>“Then go relieve yourself and eat.”<br><br>“Wow! That's a method!”<br><br>“......”<br><br>Typical Cheong Pung.<br><br>He was munching on dumplings while effortlessly practicing his Qinggong. An enigma, indeed.<br><br>As for me, burdened with Jeok Cheon-Gang on my back, I was hardly in a better state than Cheong Pung.<br><br>I idly scratched my head, observing them.<br><br>‘Hmm. This won’t do as it is.’<br><br>Our trek spanned from Henan through Shaanxi to Sichuan.<br><br>A month-long journey by horse.<br><br>But time was a luxury we couldn’t afford.<br><br>We needed a bolder strategy to cut down our travel time significantly.<br><br>“Huff, Chief! Why did you call me?”<br><br>“Oh, it's nothing much.”<br><br>I asked Hyuk Mu-Jin.<br><br>“Do you still have that thing I entrusted to you last time?”<br><br>“Entrusted? What thing?”<br><br>“The chains.”<br><br>“What chains... Ah, the ones you used to have hanging all over?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>Those were the Ten Thousand Year Tempered Steel chains, crafted by the Scorching Clan.<br><br>Before the Great Celestial Banquet commenced, I had removed them. Hyuk Mu-Jin, intrigued by their Ten Thousand Year Tempered Steel make, eagerly claimed them.<br><br>“Did you bring them?”<br><br>He was always sharp.<br><br>Hyuk Mu-Jin's eyes darted around, betraying his unease.<br><br>“No, I left them somewhere else.”<br><br>“Is that so?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Then let's do this. If you end up dying because you didn’t bring them, that’s on you.”<br><br>“Ah, silly me. Now that I think about it, I did bring them.”<br><br>Clank.<br><br>He began unwrapping the chains concealed beneath his garments.<br><br>Made from Ten Thousand Year Tempered Steel, these chains were not only robust but also feather-light.<br><br>He had ingeniously used them as makeshift armor.<br><br>Given their value, it was clear why Hyuk Mu-Jin hesitated as he handed them over.<br><br>“Weren’t these given to me to use? I was saving them to make a weapon later…”<br><br>“Did I tell you to keep them, or did I tell you to take care of them?”<br><br>“But, isn’t it wrong to give something and then take it back?”<br><br>“It’s borrowed. This belongs to the Scorching Clan. I wonder how Grandfather will react when he wakes up and sees you with it.”<br><br>“…Please, just take it. Hide it so well that it doesn't even catch my eye.”<br><br>“Good thinking. Gibang!”<br><br>I called over a baffled Goong Gibang, chains in hand, ready for the next step.<br><br>Both of them, bewildered, queried in unison.<br><br>"What are you doing right now?"<br><br>"What kind of nonsense is this?"<br><br>Sshhh.<br><br>I casually replied.<br><br>"Can't you see? I'm tying knots with the chains."<br><br>"But, why are you wrapping it around my waist...?"<br><br>"Hold on. Untie this."<br><br>"There, done."<br><br>I surveyed my handiwork, feeling a surge of accomplishment.<br><br>Hyuk Mu-Jin, Goong Gibang, and I were now interconnected, akin to dried fish threaded on a line.<br><br>“Did everyone rest well?”<br><br>“Rest? We barely had a moment.”<br><br>“Untie this right now!”<br><br>I simply grinned and shook my head.<br><br>Simultaneously, my Dantian surged with energy, channeling ninety years' worth into my legs. \[Note: the MC is not using all of his Qi here, hence "90 years".\]<br><br>“Now, let’s run.”<br><br>Swoooosh!<br><br>“Ughhhhh! This is crazy!”<br><br>“The Chief has gone mad! He’s trying to kill us!”<br><br>Bound to me, Goong Gibang and Hyuk Mu-Jin sprinted desperately, reminiscent of panicked boars.<br><br>Alerted by the commotion, Cheong Pung, who had been squatting in a nearby bush, hurried out and followed.<br><br>“Savior! I’ll come too!”<br><br>“......”<br><br>That guy probably didn't wipe. No, he must have.<br><br>Dismissing the thought, I launched into my Qinggong, racing against the backdrop of swiftly changing landscapes.<br><br>In just two days, we arrived at the Henan-Shaanxi border.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>Trudge. Trudge.<br><br>Haggard, fatigued faces. A group of individuals, all part of the escort agency, trudged onward.<br><br>The couriers and thickly-clad cart drivers all bore the weight of exhaustion.<br><br>Their fatigue stemmed from more than just the four-month trade journey.<br><br>“Hwa-Ran.”<br><br>The call caught her attention, and her sharp black eyes shifted. A firm voice responded.<br><br>“Speak, Uncle Heo.”<br><br>“Well, you see.”<br><br>The man who stepped forward was middle-aged, his beard streaked with white. He paused, then sighed deeply.<br><br>“Chief Escort Seok has passed away.”<br><br>“……!”<br><br>Ju Hwa-Ran, perched atop her horse, tensed. A quivering voice followed.<br><br>“So it has come to this, after all.”<br><br>“The poison had reached his marrow; there was nothing more we could do. I'm sorry.”<br><br>“It's not your fault, Uncle. The death of Chief Escort Seok, no, Brother Seok, is my fault.”<br><br>Under her veil, Ju Hwa-Ran’s lips trembled.<br><br>Her missteps had led to this tragedy.<br><br>Chief Escort Seok's death, and the loss of thirty-two others, were consequences of her errors.<br><br>‘Father. What should I do?’<br><br>Her eyes lifted to the heavens.<br><br>The night sky, speckled with stars, conjured the image of a man. Her father, Ju Ho-Gun, had been grappling with Qi Deviation, teetering on the brink of death.<br><br>‘Having such a beautiful and talented daughter, I couldn't ask for more. Ha ha!’<br><br>Ju Ho-Gun would often say that.<br><br>While others might have adopted a son, he cherished his gifted and beautiful sole daughter, taking immense pride in her.<br><br>‘The only one to succeed me is you. The last fifty years of Dragon Pheonix Armed Escort Agency pale in comparison to what you will achieve.’<br><br>Ju Ho-Gun's pride in his daughter was renowned across Shaanxi.<br><br>But Ju Hwa-Ran was not just a doting father's fancy.<br><br>Even as a youth, she demonstrated a keen grasp of the agency's finances and was lauded as one of Northern Jiangbei's Three Beauties.<br><br>Her martial prowess placed her among the Ten Dragons and Phoenixes, the elite of the righteous martial artists.<br><br>Yet...<br><br>‘Where did it all go wrong?’<br><br>Ju Hwa-Ran swallowed a sigh welling up from deep within her heart.<br><br>Her world was crumbling. Only two years had passed since she took the reins of the Dragon Phoenix Armed Escort Agency after her father's fall.<br><br>“Hwa-Ran, are you alright?”<br><br>The only constant was her people.<br><br>The five-decade legacy of trust and goodwill her grandfather and father had built was her sole pillar of strength.<br><br>Ju Hwa-Ran offered a faint smile to Heo Jun, the chief courier, who inquired with evident concern.<br><br>“You don’t need to worry about me, Uncle Heo.”<br><br>“If that’s the case, I’m relieved.”<br><br>Heo Jun nodded with a somber face.<br><br>Ju Hwa-Ran was just twenty-one.<br><br>She had much to shoulder, perhaps too much for her young heart.<br><br>Heo Jun, laden with guilt, could only offer his silent support.<br><br>Sensing his sentiments, Ju Hwa-Ran steadied herself and commanded.<br><br>“It’s getting dark; we should camp here for tonight. Please make the arrangements.”<br><br>“That’s a good idea.”<br><br>“And... prepare for the funeral as well.”<br><br>The thirty-third casualty of this mission. It was time to bid farewell to Chief Escort Seok, a lifelong companion.<br><br>They might stall the decomposition with salt, but once their journey ended, the residual poison would devastate his remains.<br><br>“I understand, take a break for now.”<br><br>“How can I rest while everyone is working hard? Don’t worry and go ahead.”<br><br>With a brief nod, Heo Jun gestured, and the caravan came to a stop.<br><br>The cool, spacious land was ideal for camping. Ju Hwa-Ran planned to recuperate here before tackling the mountain at dawn.<br><br>‘We’re almost there.’<br><br>Her gaze fixed on the dark silhouette of Mount Heukseok, or Black Stone Mountain.<br><br>Crossing it marked the final leg of their journey.<br><br>Success here could offer the Dragon Phoenix Armed Escort Agency a much-needed respite.<br><br>‘Seven days to Mount Zhongnan. Not ideal, but crossing Black Stone Mountain will buy us time.’<br><br>The real challenge was the attitude of Black Stone Mountain's master.<br><br>Black Stone Fortress, a bastion of the Green Forest Alliance within the Eighteen Fortresses, was led by a peak master renowned for his acumen in wealth. \[Note: the Green Forest Alliance is a historical slang for a group of thieves and bandits, so that may hold true for this novel as well.\]<br><br>A clash with the Black Stone Fortress might bring more suffering to the already beleaguered Dragon Phoenix Armed Escort Agency.<br><br>‘I hope nothing goes wrong.’<br><br>Engulfed in her thoughts, Ju Hwa-Ran’s focus was abruptly shattered.<br><br>Rustle.<br><br>The sound was subtle, not that of wild animals, but more akin to dry leaves being tread upon.<br><br>A surge of alarm coursed through Ju Hwa-Ran.<br><br>‘Enemy!’<br><br>Swoosh!<br><br>With lightning speed, Ju Hwa-Ran unsheathed her soft sword, her voice cutting through the stillness.<br><br>“Identify yourself!”<br><br>Her command resonated in the darkness.<br><br>Heo Jun, the chief courier, instantly grasped the gravity of the situation and mobilized the couriers to form a protective circle.<br><br>“Protect the young mistress of the agency!”<br><br>“Yes!”<br><br>Clash!<br><br>The moonlight caught the shimmer of their drawn weapons.<br><br>Then, the rustling intensified, emanating from the bushes some fifty yards distant.<br><br>“Who is it, you ask? The brave couriers of the Dragon Pheonix Armed Escort Agency, I see.”<br><br>A towering figure emerged, an eight-foot-tall behemoth with a massive axe slung across his back. Heo Jun’s voice dropped to a whisper.<br><br>“Thousand Strength Axe…”<br><br>“Oh, isn’t that you, Brother Heo? I heard you’ve been busy cleaning up after a young girl.”<br><br>“How dare you!”<br><br>Beside the tense Heo Jun, a poised figure stepped forth with boldness.<br><br>“It’s good timing. We were about to pay the toll.”<br><br>“Well, well.”<br><br>Thousand Strength Axe smirked and brandished his axe.<br><br>“Show me the goods first, then we can talk.”<br><br>Ssssssh!<br><br>In his wake, hundreds from the Green Forest Alliance emerged, ready for confrontation.</p>
