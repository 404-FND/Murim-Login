                        <p>Seok Go-Jun was brimming with resolve.<br><br>'I can do it.' \[Note: We are still referring to the last conversation of the previous chapter. Most likely Seok Go-Jun is thinking about how he can definitively beat the MC in a fight.\]<br><br>It had been nearly 30 years since the Great Cataclysm tore his life apart, orphaning him in its wake. It was during these tumultuous times that he first encountered Lee Jeong-Ryong.<br><br>'I've been watching you for a while. Would you like to join me?'<br><br>'Me?'<br><br>'Yes. You have exceptional talent.'<br><br>It was then that he understood.<br><br>He realized how he, an orphan with no prospects, had managed to receive top-tier education in an environment conducive to growth. The identity of the mysterious benefactor, whom he had never once seen, finally made sense.<br><br>This benefactor wasn't the archetypal figure from fairy tales, yet that was all the more reason for Seok Go-Jun to accept his offer.<br><br>'Yes, sir.'<br><br>'From now on, call me Master.'<br><br>And so began a new chapter in Seok Go-Jun's life.<br><br>He diligently learned unfamiliar techniques and breathing exercises alongside other children, cherishing every moment. His youthful hands bore the marks of his labor—blisters that burst and healed into calluses.<br><br>In many ways, Seok Go-Jun's life mirrored this transformation: enduring pain, healing, and emerging stronger.<br><br>As he grew more resilient, he eventually earned his place beside Lee Jeong-Ryong.<br><br>'From today, you are the head of the security team.'<br><br>'Please tell me what I should and shouldn't do.'<br><br>'Follow my orders, and don't go against them. That's all.'<br><br>Lee Jeong-Ryong's words resonated deeply within Seok Go-Jun.<br><br>He devoted himself to fulfilling the objectives set by his Master.<br><br>Whether in the shadows or under the spotlight, Seok Go-Jun executed his duties flawlessly.<br><br>Contrary to the hunters who basked in their prowess and led lives of ostentation, he quietly tackled the tasks assigned by Lee Jeong-Ryong, concealing his true capabilities.<br><br>Within the Ares Guild, his true power was a subject of speculation. The only person privy to the extent of his abilities was Lee Jeong-Ryong himself.<br><br>'Don't you feel suffocated?'<br><br>'What do you mean?'<br><br>'Staying only by my side.'<br><br>'I've never thought about it.'<br><br>'With your skills, you could make a name for yourself anywhere right now.'<br><br>'I'm not interested in that. I will always protect you, Master.'<br><br>'Haha, you seem even more reliable today.'<br><br>It was sincere. Among all the members of the security team trained by Lee Jeong-Ryong, none displayed the level of blind worship and respect as Seok Go-Jun did.<br><br>His extraordinary abilities combined with his unwavering devotion were unparalleled.<br><br>Yet, paradoxically, these very virtues - his skill and loyalty - were what drove Seok Go-Jun to eventually defy an order from Lee Jeong-Ryong.<br><br>"If it wasn’t for the special instruction from my Master... you would be dead here."<br><br>"Your Master? Ah, Jeong-Ryong?"<br><br>"…!"<br><br>"How’s Jeong-Ryong doing? Isn't it about time to look for a place in Silver Town?"<br><br>Mentioning Lee Jeong-Ryong in such a manner was beyond an insult. To Seok Go-Jun, Lee Jeong-Ryong was more than a mentor; he was akin to a parent, a guide, and to some extent, a deity.<br><br>For a devout follower like Seok Go-Jun, blasphemy against his 'god' was intolerable.<br><br>'I will kill this bastard...'<br><br>As the command to avoid conflict with the Peace Guild faded from his consciousness, a fierce aura began to swirl around his clenched fist.<br><br>"If you think it will be the same as last time... I'll make you regret it."<br><br>Seok Go-Jun recalled his brief skirmish with Jin Tae-Kyung at the hospital a week earlier.<br><br>That encounter had been restricted by his Master's orders, his true strength barely revealed.<br><br>But now, Jin Tae-Kyung was about to face the full force of his pent-up fury.<br><br>'I'll use all my strength and finish it in one blow.'<br><br>Consequences were irrelevant. His sole focus was on delivering retribution for the insult to his Master.<br><br>And in Seok Go-Jun's mind, his victory was certain.<br><br>"Die!"<br><br>Whoosh!<br><br>With a sound akin to the air itself being torn asunder, his fist rocketed forward at blinding speed.<br><br>Jin Tae-Kyung was only three steps away, standing with a broad smile and arms wide open.<br><br>He was defenseless.<br><br>In slow-motion, Seok Go-Jun's fist was aimed with lethal intent, yet Jin Tae-Kyung stood unmoved.<br><br>'It's over, kid.'<br><br>A smug smile crept across Jin Tae-Kyung’s face.<br><br>Kwang-!<br><br>The air erupted with a sound like the heavens splitting apart.<br><br>But Seok Go-Jun was oblivious to it, engulfed by the intense recoil and the scorching heat radiating from his fist.<br><br>'This is…'<br><br>The world around Seok Go-Jun fractured into blinding whiteness, a searing agony slicing through him, reminiscent of a red-hot blade carving through his insides.<br><br>A guttural cry, raw and involuntary, tore from his gaping mouth.<br><br>“Kueeek!”<br><br>Whoosh.<br><br>Doubled over, Seok Go-Jun's eyes bulged in shock as he coughed out his insides.<br><br>Blood - a relentless, dark red tide - pooled around him.<br><br>Amidst the crimson flood, pale fragments floated, their true nature horrifyingly apparent. Pieces of his own intestines.<br><br>"What in the world is this…"<br><br>His bewildered gaze fixated on the pool of his lifeblood, his view abruptly eclipsed by a pair of feet.<br><br>"Didn't I say I would make you regret it?"<br><br>"…!"<br><br>"It's strange. It doesn't seem like much."<br><br>He knew without having to lift his head.<br><br>He knew whose feet were stepping in his blood, whose voice echoed in his ears as his brain rapidly fogged over.<br><br>'How could I... how could I be defeated by a single strike…'<br><br>One clash. It was a pillar of fire that turned the tower Seok Go-Jun had built over the last 30 years into ashes.<br><br>'Is this even possible?'<br><br>Tremors wracked Seok Go-Jun's form.<br><br>Pain?<br><br>No, it was fear, a terror he had only ever reserved for one person - his Master, Lee Jeong-Ryong.<br><br>"Lift your head."<br><br>That same fear seemed to clench his hair, coercing his head upwards.<br><br>Feet, steeped in the bloodbath. Ascending past legs, firm and unyielding like steel, to a torso echoing the lithe strength of a wild beast, and then…<br><br>Those eyes.<br><br>They were dark forests veiled in shadows. Two burning coals gazed at Seok Go-Jun.<br><br>"Tell your Master."<br><br>The hot breath brushed his ear, a whisper meant solely for him.<br><br>"As long as I am here, no one can touch the Peace Guild."<br><br>"…!"<br><br>Seok Go-Jun's eyelids fluttered weakly, a raspy whisper escaping his blood-drenched lips.<br><br>"What in the world... are you?"<br><br>"Me?"<br><br>The response didn't reach his ears but echoed ominously in his mind.<br><br>\- I am the successor of the Fire King, the heir to the Scorching Clan.<br><br>It was like an auditory hallucination.<br><br>Seok Go-Jun, quickly fading, didn't recognize the Sound Transmission, nor could he fathom the significance of those words.<br><br>Only one word came to his mind.<br><br>'Monster…'<br><br>With a mischievous smile, Jin Tae-Kyung's face was the last thing Seok Go-Jun saw before his body crumbled like a rotten tree.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>Swoosh. Thud!<br><br>A heavy, suffocating silence engulfed the area. Nobody dared to utter a word or make a move. Hundreds of eyes, wide with trepidation, flicked towards me.<br><br>I gazed down at the unconscious Seok Go-Jun and delivered my verdict in a low murmur.<br><br>"Why mess around and cause such a fuss? You're nothing special."<br><br>"…!"<br><br>"…!"<br><br>The air seemed to solidify with tension. As I diverted my gaze from Seok Go-Jun, a wave of gasps and murmurs broke the silence.<br><br>Among the crowd, one reaction stood out sharply.<br><br>"Association President."<br><br>"Oh!"<br><br>Lee Woo-Jung, the President of the Seoul Association, jerked in surprise, hastily averting his eyes.<br><br>"Did you call me?"<br><br>"Why are you suddenly speaking formally? You were speaking casually just a moment ago."<br><br>The Association President faltered, his complexion draining of color.<br><br>"Are you talking to me?"<br><br>"Don't you remember?"<br><br>"Recently, my memory hasn't been so good, I keep forgetting…"<br><br>"Oh, I see. Then you must have already forgotten what happened between us today?"<br><br>"…!"<br><br>"Your expression suggests you haven't forgotten."<br><br>He wouldn't be in such a high position if he didn't understand what needed to happen now. \[Note: MC is suggesting that deals made to "forget what you saw" between Lee Woo-Jung and the Ares Guild were what pushed him to his President position in the first place.\]<br><br>At my question, the Association President hastily shook his head.<br><br>"No, I have. I will take care of keeping everyone's mouth shut."<br><br>"Keeping their mouths shut?"<br><br>"Ah, no, not that."<br><br>"Everyone who came with you also has poor memory, right?"<br><br>"Yes, yes. That's right. These folks all suffer from short-term memory loss. Isn't that so?"<br><br>About two hundred association hunters, who had accompanied him, nodded vehemently in agreement.<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>"Of course. I don't even remember my name."<br><br>"Wait, where is this? Who am I?"<br><br>Who was the last guy to speak?<br><br>I barely restrained myself from turning in his direction.<br><br>"Well, that's good."<br><br>My broad smile was mirrored by the Association President and the other hunters, though theirs seemed forced.<br><br>With this many onlookers, I doubted this would be sufficient to ensure their silence.<br><br>Now, for the next move...<br><br>"Who's the person in charge here?"<br><br>"I am."<br><br>A middle-aged man with sharp eyes, an A-rank hunter and a team leader of the Ares Guild, stepped forward.<br><br>His gaze oscillated between me and the fallen Seok Go-Jun, a mix of disbelief and concern etched on his face. He bit his lip, pondering the situation.<br><br>"I don't know what business you had with Team Leader Seok, but... you've made a serious mistake."<br><br>His words betrayed his ignorance of the full scope of internal affairs.<br><br>My response came with a smirk.<br><br>"In life, there are all sorts of situations like this, right?"<br><br>"Aren't you worried about how the Vice Guild Master will react when he hears about today's incident?"<br><br>"Not worried, but I am looking forward to it. Make sure to report to Jeong-Ryong."<br><br>My reply seemed to shock not only the middle-aged man but also the other members of the Ares Guild behind him.<br><br>Whether it was my casual reference to Lee Jeong-Ryong or my apparent indifference, I couldn't discern.<br><br>My thoughts were preoccupied not with their reactions, but with how Lee Jeong-Ryong would respond to the report.<br><br>'Poor Jeong-Ryong. He's going to have a headache.'<br><br>In this unfolding drama, Lee Jeong-Ryong played the role of a cleaner.<br><br>He seemed to always be meticulously working to ensure no ripple of these incidents disturbed the surface.<br><br>'But to show his teeth again so soon after the first incident... Impressive, really.'<br><br>The swift aggression shown by Lee Jeong-Ryong, despite the recent conclusion of our delicate negotiations, sent a chill through me.<br><br>'What if I had really died here?'<br><br>The implications were clear. Without me, the Peace Guild would crumble against the colossal might of Ares.<br><br>This realization struck me anew.<br><br>'If I let my guard down even for a moment, this battle is over.'<br><br>In this relentless war, there was no pause for breath. The enemies were ever-vigilant, always ready to strike.<br><br>"Phew."<br><br>At least the immediate crisis was contained.<br><br>Or not...<br><br>"..."<br><br>"..."<br><br>"..."<br><br>"..."<br><br>Four pairs of eyes bore into me with intensity, accompanied by dozens of others filled with questions, demanding explanations.<br><br>'Ah, I forgot about our guild.'<br><br>I had overlooked a crucial aspect amidst the chaos. But how to even begin explaining this?<br><br>After a brief internal debate, I chose my words.<br><br>"I went to pee."<br><br>"..."<br><br>A moment of silence.<br><br>Song Song suddenly spoke in a tone I hadn't heard before.<br><br>"Tae-Kyung."<br><br>"Yeah?"<br><br>"Is it okay if I kill you?"<br><br>"...Let's go outside, and I'll explain."<br><br>Yes, let's go outside first.</p>
