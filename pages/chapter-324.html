                        <p>Kwaaaaa!<br><br>The Fire of Calamity erupted, devouring the lingering chill of early spring.<br><br>Dozens of phantasmal blades from the Tai Yi Spectral Sword, shimmering and multiplying, merged into a singular, formidable weapon.<br><br>Sword Aura and Fire of Calamity clashed, an epic collision of powers.<br><br>Gugugugung!<br><br>A thunderous roar reverberated, muffling all sound, as a vortex of energy encircled the old and young man at its epicenter.<br><br>Blue flames wrapped around the wind and surged through the ceiling of Dengwang Tower, soaring like a dragon.<br><br>Witnessing this, Hwang Bo-Eom's eyes flickered.<br><br>‘Fire Dragon…!'<br><br>Unbeknownst to him, his once pristine white beard had turned black with soot.<br><br>Engulfed by the young man's intense gaze, Hwang Bo-Eom was oblivious to everything else, his senses overwhelmed.<br><br>'It's scorching.'<br><br>This unexpected display of Transcendent power was astounding.<br><br>His body, fortified by years of martial training, was impervious to extremes of temperature.<br><br>Yet, the young man's fiery eyes conveyed more than heat.<br><br>They radiated anger, combativeness, and even a strand of chilling logic.<br><br>How could this be? This youth, barely mature...<br><br>“Cough.”<br><br>Gugugrr.<br><br>With a dry, hacking cough, Hwang Bo-Eom spat out blood, his gaze fixed on the young man's spear.<br><br>The spear, enshrouded in bluish-white flames, featured a translucent silver blade.<br><br>A manifestation of Protective Qi, still incomplete.<br><br>'No, it's not that. He hasn't yet broken through the barrier. But how could this old man...'<br><br>Hwang Bo-Eom, who had transcended that barrier a decade ago.<br><br>How could he, enlightened through years of rigorous training and meditation, be bested by a youth barely at the Peak Realm?<br><br>“…How is this possible?”<br><br>The young man's response was succinct.<br><br>“Because I'm stronger.”<br><br>“…!”<br><br>The spear, resonating with a low hum, exerted immense pressure on Hwang Bo-Eom.<br><br>Kagagagak!<br><br>“Hah!”<br><br>His sudden outburst of power and the use of his ultimate martial arts techniques were all in vain.<br><br>The energy channeling through the spear was of Divine Strength, transcending human limits, echoing myths from his youth.<br><br>'Pangu.'<br><br>The primordial giant who swung an axe to create the world. \[Note: In Chinese mythology, Pangu, the first being, emerged from a cosmic egg and used a giant axe to separate Yin and Yang, creating heaven and earth. After his death, his body transformed into various elements of the natural world.\]<br><br>Before him stood a young man, embodying the might of deities within his mortal frame, wielding more than just Divine Strength.<br><br>Seureuk!<br><br>The perceptiveness of a Transcendent Master far eclipses that of a typical martial artist.<br><br>Yet, Hwang Bo-Eom couldn't evade the unforeseen silver streak.<br><br>Decades had passed since he last experienced such pain; the sudden eruption of blood from his shoulder widened his eyes in shock.<br><br>'When did he...'<br><br>The attack was imperceptible, surpassing even the capabilities of the Tai Yi Spectral Sword, the Southern Edge Sect's pride.<br><br>Hwang Bo-Eom, after dedicating eighty years to mastering the Southern Edge Sect’s martial arts, exclaimed in disbelief.<br><br>“This can’t be! It's impossible!”<br><br>Kwagwagwang!<br><br>With a surge of energy, the Protective Qi around his blade ignited, resembling an untamed blaze.<br><br>Narrowly escaping the onslaught, Hwang Bo-Eom, his fingers trembling, pointed at the young man.<br><br>“Who are you... exactly?”<br><br>“You already know.”<br><br>Jin Tae-Kyung, the young man, spat out with the boldness of a street thug.<br><br>“The future nineteenth leader of the Scorching Clan.”<br><br>Hwareureureuk!<br><br>The Fire of Calamity wrapped around the transparent spear blade, crackling and roaring with renewed ferocity.<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>Ssiaeeeaak! Gwang!<br><br>Spear and sword clashed, locked in a fleeting yet intense exchange.<br><br>The Fire of Calamity and Sword Aura destroyed everything in their vicinity in a rapid succession of blows.<br><br>Shhh! Crack!<br><br>With a quick blink, I shifted my stance. A surge of energy burst forth from his sword, raised skyward, slicing through a distant column as if it were mere tofu, sending it crumbling.<br><br>Leaping up, I navigated the wooden debris cascading from above. My movements were paradoxical - light yet substantial, fluid yet abrupt.<br><br>It felt akin to an unfurling flame.<br><br>‘This is truly what the Brilliant Path of Fire was created for.’<br><br>I was suddenly buoyant, caught in a moment where time seemed to crawl. I alone moved with haste, as light and swift as a darting bullet.<br><br>Ding!<br><br>\- Enlightenment finds you in various ways. Through endless practice and meditation, and life-and-death battles.<br><br>\- \[Brilliant Path of Fire\] has reached seventh mastery!<br><br>\- You have gained a considerable amount of experience!<br><br>Paaang!<br><br>A burst of energy propelled me forward. As the system notification chimed, I found myself face-to-face with Hwang Bo-Eom.<br><br>Was it because of the unexpected enlightenment, or the increased speed? Suddenly I was too close to thrust my spear.<br><br>Instead of withdrawing, I extended an open palm.<br><br>Hnngh!<br><br>My palm, cutting through the air with fiery speed, reached forward. Hwang Bo-Eom, roaring mightily, countered with his own palm.<br><br>His aged palm radiated a dazzling azure glow - the Southern Edge Sect's revered Heaven's Firmament Azure Palm. \[Note: the direct translation of the move is something like "Azure Cloud Heavenly Steel Hand" but I have made a stylistic choice here.\]<br><br>Yet, he lacked time to fully harness his Palm Aura. \[Note: like Sword Aura, but now Hwang Bo-Eom is using a Palm technique.\]<br><br>Ha.<br><br>'I'm faster.'<br><br>Clap! Hnngh.<br><br>Our palms clashed, followed by a pained groan.<br><br>Hwang Bo-Eom, his face ashen from internal injuries, clenched his teeth and extended his other hand towards me.<br><br>Papapat!<br><br>Five wind blades sliced through the air, their effort in vain.<br><br>In an instant, if I hadn’t caught his wrist with the Claw of the Fire Dragon, I would have been injured.<br><br>'He's finished. Where does he find the audacity to keep going?'<br><br>Crunch.<br><br>With my thumb, index, and middle fingers, I twisted his captive wrist. A muffled scream escaped his gritted teeth.<br><br>Tai Yi Ruthless Sword, Hwang Bo-Eom. It had been ages since he last felt such agony.<br><br>As the curtain falls, the actors depart the stage.<br><br>The epoch of the Great Faction War, a stage for heroes, had faded into history fifty years prior, leaving its champions dispersed.<br><br>The Hwang Bo-Eom before me now was no longer the hero of lore, but a diminished, petty old man.<br><br>'This is going to hurt, you ancient bastard.'<br><br>Releasing his weakened wrist, I uncurled my fingers, previously shaped like a dragon's talons.<br><br>Kkaddeuk.<br><br>Daily, I had honed a single stance, each repetition burdened with hundreds of kilograms of iron.<br><br>Rooted firmly in the stance, my lower body like deep-seated roots, my waist a sturdy pillar, and my fist, guided by Jeok Cheon-Gang's precise teachings, never strayed an inch.<br><br>'At first, I shattered rocks.'<br><br>And cleaved through waterfalls cascading from great heights.<br><br>'Then, I pulverized cliffs.'<br><br>My knuckles, now as tough as a tortoise shell from endless fractures and healings, glowed with a blue-white flame.<br><br>The time it took to assume the position and throw the punch was merely a moment.<br><br>'Flame-Extinguishing Divine Fist.'<br><br>Sssssss.<br><br>The Scorching Yang Qi evaporated all the moisture within a few meters. Hwang Bo-Eom's lips, cracked like a drought-stricken field, parted.<br><br>"Don't-!"<br><br>“Okay.”<br><br>As I uttered these words, the Flame-Extinguishing Divine Fist was unleashed.<br><br>The protective Qi of the Transcendent Master attempted to ward off the strike, but it faltered almost instantly; my punch shattered the energy shield around him and collided with his fragile flesh and bones.<br><br>Kwajik!<br><br>“Aaaaargh!”<br><br>Propelled backwards by the force, Hwang Bo-Eom crashed through three pillars and a wall, bringing the remainder of the ceiling down with him.<br><br>Just as I thought this was the end, a pair of bloodshot eyes pierced through the settling dust cloud.<br><br>“Cough, hyugh!”<br><br>“Just stay down. If you want to save what little life you have left.”<br><br>“How could you, you…”<br><br>A tempest of shock, rage, humiliation, and disbelief swirled within Hwang Bo-Eom's gaze.<br><br>Eventually, they converged into a singular, potent emotion.<br><br>'Hatred.'<br><br>His blood-stained lips parted slowly. Blood, mingled with fragments of his innards, oozed out, but Hwang Bo-Eom's eyes blazed with an unyielding ferocity.<br><br>In his eyes, I saw the recklessness of a man indifferent to consequences.<br><br>"I am... the First Sword of the Southern Edge Sect."<br><br>As he spoke, the surrounding hot wind subsided, replaced by a chilling breeze. This cold wind emanated from a solitary figure, from a single sword.<br><br>Feeling my overheated blood begin to cool, I murmured to myself.<br><br>"This is...”<br><br>“Tai Yi Invisible Sword. Look closely. With this, I will sever your breath."<br><br>Shiiing-<br><br>The sword glided, the wind followed. They were one and the same - each slash bringing a wind sharper than any steel.<br><br>A potent aroma of blood hung in the air.<br><br>Squeeeee!<br><br>A slight sidestep, a movement that spared my life.<br><br>The wound on my neck, seeping blood, didn't register in my mind. Invisible sword strikes from Hwang Bo-Eom's distant blade assailed me like relentless waves.<br><br>Whoosh, whoosh!<br><br>Pain lanced my side. The sword's energy reverberated within me.<br><br>Reeling, I raised my arm. An attack, narrowly missing, cleaved through a beam as if it were mere tofu.<br><br>'What is this?'<br><br>Slice!<br><br>But I had no time to contemplate. Another cut opened across my chest. Blood gushed, drenching the ground.<br><br>'I can't see it.'<br><br>It was like being shrouded in thick fog.<br><br>This wasn't a battle of mere strength or speed. It was a transcendent sword technique, wielded by a martial artist whose enlightenment surpassed mine, even as his power dwindled.<br><br>But...<br><br>'How have I been able to avoid it until now?'<br><br>This question suddenly consumed my thoughts.<br><br>Dozens of sword strikes rained down on my immobilized form. I gazed blankly at the onslaught.<br><br>Then, I closed my eyes. In the ensuing darkness, the face of one person danced before me.<br><br>His clear voice echoed faintly.<br><br>'In Murim, keep your eyes wide open, and you won’t get cut down by a sword.'<br><br>'What if I face death anyway?'<br><br>'Then pluck out those useless eyes and see with your heart.'<br><br>‘My heart? How would I even do that?'<br><br>'Have you tried it?'<br><br>Yes. I have.<br><br>Well, I am right now.<br><br>'This was what you were trying to teach me, right?'<br><br>A smile unknowingly crept onto my face.<br><br>Blind to the world, yet acutely perceptive, I sensed the imminent sword strikes shrouded in darkness. These were the desperate final efforts of the Tai Yi Ruthless Sword, Hwang Bo-Eom.<br><br>'Thank you for the lesson, Grandfather.'<br><br>With eyes sealed shut, I maneuvered my body, each movement as finely tuned as a pianist's keystroke.<br><br>The sword strikes, missing my flesh, shredded my clothing and scarred the earth.<br><br>Kwagwagwagwagwang!<br><br>Amidst the cacophony, I slowly opened my eyes. Hwang Bo-Eom's face, etched with shock, entered my view.<br><br>His eyes revealed an emotion none had ever witnessed in him before.<br><br>'Fear.'<br><br>He must know it too. That's why he's so afraid.<br><br>My face will be the last thing this old man sees.<br><br>"Don't, don't come closer!"<br><br>Shiiik!<br><br>Advancing a step, I brandished my spear. The sword aiming for my neck met my spear blade and dissipated.<br><br>And then another step.<br><br>Shishishisheung!<br><br>My spear maneuvers were as instinctive as drawing breath. Deflecting, blocking, thrusting – akin to battling a live adversary, yet my advance was relentless.<br><br>I was methodical, and Hwang Bo-Eom was frantic. Disregarding his own physical limits, he unleashed his ultimate strike.<br><br>Kwaaaaa!<br><br>A Sword Aura, potent enough to obliterate the entire hall, surged towards me.<br><br>I observed it nearing, then with a swift motion, my spear struck like a bolt of lightning.<br><br>Heavenly Strike.<br><br>The Claw of the Fire Dragon ensnared the Sword Aura.<br><br>And in the next moment.<br><br>Snap!<br><br>The fragments of the shattered sword lay strewn across the ground. Hwang Bo-Eom, his gaze transfixed on the remnants of his once-mighty weapon, slowly lifted his head.<br><br>“What the hell are you?”<br><br>"Why..."<br><br>I spoke deliberately, addressing Hwang Bo-Eom, the First Sword of the Southern Edge Sect, the renowned Tai Yi Ruthless Sword.<br><br>"Why would you insult someone else’s master and act like such a fucking asshole? You're just an old man who is a disgrace to his Sect. Prepare to die, you old bastard."</p>
