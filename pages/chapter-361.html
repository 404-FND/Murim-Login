                        <p>Plod, plod.<br><br>Steady, unwavering steps echoed through the corridors, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's stride devoid of any rush or pause.<br><br>Amidst the cascade of crumbling stones from the ceiling and the engulfing darkness, his composure remained intact.<br><br>After all, the Four Great Demon Lords were powerful beings.<br><br>Though all the power in the world could not rid the Western Heavenly Demon Lord of one fear: failing to fulfill the esteemed decree of the Heavenly Lord.<br><br>"To think I was detained by that child, Jin Tae-Kyung, for so long."<br><br>The delay had been unforeseen.<br><br>Reminded of Jin Tae-Kyung, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord subconsciously touched his forehead.<br><br>There was only a nagging ache and pronounced swelling. Yet this injury was more bothersome than his lacerated hands and bleeding shoulder.<br><br>'How?'<br><br>Jin Tae-Kyung was hanging by his neck while his limbs were shattered.<br><br>His Qi was depleted, and with injuries that severe, a normal Peak Master would have died long ago...<br><br>'To think I couldn't fully block it even with protective Qi.'<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord let out a derisive snort.<br><br>Jin Tae-Kyung had penetrated his protective Qi with a mere headbutt and inflicted injury upon him. It defied all logic.<br><br>To the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, Jin Tae-Kyung epitomized utter desperation and determination.<br><br>'Isn't this truly supernatural strength?'<br><br>It was as intriguing as it was unsettling.<br><br>Although Cheong Pung, in the Transcendent Realm, outmatched Jin Tae-Kyung in martial prowess, the threat Jin Tae-Kyung posed stemmed from a different quality.<br><br>'His strength resides in his very nature.'<br><br>His martial capability was extraordinary for a Peak Master, and he seemed to be fueled by an inconceivable resolve.<br><br>Had Jin Tae-Kyung not been on the brink of exhaustion, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord would not have hesitated to strangle him.<br><br>But now, everything was smoothly coming to an end.<br><br>"Is this the place?"<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord's footsteps halted in front of a firmly shut iron door. While most of the prison cells were made of bars, the treatment room's massive iron door stood out conspicuously.<br><br>Of course, no barrier could withstand the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>'Let's see what's inside.'<br><br>Without a moment's delay, he unleashed a Qi-laden strike upon the iron door.<br><br>It sliced through both the door and its lock effortlessly.<br><br>Clang, boom!<br><br>The iron door, now bisected, crashed to the ground with resounding force.<br><br>Striding confidently into the treatment room, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord spotted a figure and offered a slight smile.<br><br>"Are you the Divine Doctor?"<br><br>Beside a cold stone bed, an elderly man seated in a chair slowly opened his eyes.<br><br>His voice, serene and composed, filled the space.<br><br>"It's just a vain title given by the people of this world."<br><br>"I've heard rumors about you. I wanted to meet you because I heard that no one knows your name, age, or even if you're a man or a woman."<br><br>"So, what do you think now that you see me?"<br><br>"You're as I thought. You seem more like a real immortal than those Taoist monks who pretend to be noble and high above the rest of us."<br><br>The Divine Doctor let out a weary sigh.<br><br>"I wish that were true. If I were an immortal, I'd have the power to drive away demons."<br><br>"Do I look like a demon to you?"<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord held his arms wide open while he spun around.<br><br>Beneath the tattered and bloodstained clothes, his appearance was remarkably ordinary, akin to any middle-aged man.<br><br>"The Heavenly Lord descended from heaven to earth, and under His almighty power are four loyal servants."<br><br>His tone was mild, yet firm.<br><br>"I am neither a demon nor an immortal. I'm just one servant following His commands."<br><br>"…!"<br><br>The Divine Doctor's eyes fluttered with a mix of disbelief and apprehension.<br><br>Heavenly Lord? A servant? The man's delusion was evident, yet his conviction was unnerving.<br><br>"Nonsense! If you, who kills without hesitation, are not a demon, then what are you?"<br><br>"It's a shame. But what can I do? Erasing those who oppose His will is also my duty."<br><br>"Who exactly are you…?"<br><br>Overwhelmed, the Divine Doctor faltered, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's sigh resonating softly.<br><br>The air grew thick with the pungent scent of blood emanating from his every word and gesture.<br><br>"Get out."<br><br>"Hm? What did you say?"<br><br>"I said get out. No one is allowed in during treatment, especially not a demon like you."<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord met the Divine Doctor's grave gaze with a burst of laughter.<br><br>"I thought you were a stubborn doctor, but you do have a sense of humor. Look here, Divine Doctor. The treatment has already ended."<br><br>"It hasn't ended."<br><br>With a grin, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord advanced, his path leading him to Jeok Cheon-Gang, who appeared lifeless.<br><br>"Well, in my opinion, it seems we need to move the patient elsewhere."<br><br>"Before that... you need the doctor's permission."<br><br>As the Divine Doctor rose, his expression stern,<br><br>Pop, pop, pop!<br><br>An array of light beams erupted from his voluminous sleeves. A myriad of needles, varying in size, darted towards their target, tracing both straight and curved trajectories aimed at the neck's vital areas.<br><br>Yet, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's laughter intensified at the spectacle.<br><br>"How amusing."<br><br>Thud, thud, thud!<br><br>Effortlessly, the powerful protective Qi surrounding him repelled the assault.<br><br>The needles quivered, halted by the Qi barrier.<br><br>"And it's a pity."<br><br>Crunch.<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord clenched and then opened his palm. An invisible force of energy, following the will of its master, snatched and crushed the needles.<br><br>Despite the Divine Doctor's martial prowess, he was outmatched by the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, the chasm between them immense.<br><br>"Let me reiterate. The treatment has ended."<br><br>"......!"<br><br>As the Western Heavenly Demon Lord spoke in a soft voice, the Divine Doctor's body floated into the air.<br><br>Psychokinesis, a feat only a possessor of a tremendous amount of Qi could perform.<br><br>The Divine Doctor's complexion turned pale as he was flung into the hands of the Western Heavenly Demon Lord. He struggled to speak with the hand encircling his throat.<br><br>"Evil... demon."<br><br>"For a doctor who has no hesitation in using lethal force, that doesn't seem like something you should say. Now, wouldn't you also be considered a demon?"<br><br>"When I think...of the blood...that stains your hands...I will gladly become a demon!"<br><br>Shick, thud.<br><br>The Divine Doctor's defiant cry and subsequent sword lunge were effortlessly thwarted.<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord, with a flicker of intrigue in his eyes, snapped the elderly doctor's wrist.<br><br>"The Patriarch was right. You do have it."<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord's attention shifted to the Divine Doctor's hand.<br><br>On his wrinkled fingers was an object that did not at all suit a doctor.<br><br>"So, this is the Ring of All Poisons..."<br><br>A ring emanating a faint luminescence, its gem capturing the both light and darkness.<br><br>Captivated, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord delicately extricated the Ring of All Poisons from the Divine Doctor's grasp, adorning it upon his own finger.<br><br>"The Heavenly Lord will be pleased."<br><br>Having witnessed the entire scene, the Divine Doctor emitted a stifled moan.<br><br>"W-what exactly are you planning to do?"<br><br>"Don't be curious. After all, your role ends here."<br><br>Shick, thud!<br><br>A force, as sharp as a blade, pierced through the Divine Doctor's abdomen.<br><br>As his dantian shattered, the Divine Doctor vomited blood and was flung far away.<br><br>"Kuweeeek!"<br><br>"It seems we no longer need the doctor's permission, do we?"<br><br>Amidst his anguish, the Divine Doctor witnessed the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's mirthful demeanor.<br><br>The quest was complete. With the Ring of All Poisons now secured and the dominant forces of Sichuan vanquished, no obstacles remained.<br><br>There was nothing left to stand in his way. The time had come to conclude everything and return.<br><br>"Come now, let's go together. There's someone who wants to see you."<br><br>The Western Heavenly Demon Lord whispered towards Jeok Cheon-Gang, who lay peacefully asleep on a cold stone bed, as he attempted to pull the Fire King's body towards him using Psychokinesis.<br><br>But it was at that moment.<br><br>Woooong.<br><br>"......!"<br><br>An ominous hum filled the air.<br><br>Or rather, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord recognized it as powerful vibrations which were gradually approaching.<br><br>'Could it be that the collapse has already begun?'<br><br>He cast his gaze towards the disturbance's origin.<br><br>Beyond the demolished entry, a dim radiance pierced the encompassing gloom.<br><br>"What is that......"<br><br>His frown deepened, and his eyes abruptly widened.<br><br>Woooong, gugugugung!<br><br>The hum escalated, ushering in a tempestuous wind.<br><br>And then.<br><br>Boom!<br><br>A blinding light shot through the treatment room.<br><br>No, it was a spear enveloped in blue flames.<br><br>The name of a certain individual flashed in his mind, prompting the Western Heavenly Demon Lord to erupt in laughter.<br><br>"Haha! You are truly supernatural!"<br><br>His laughter boomed as a profound darkness surged from his body.<br><br>White Flames, wrapped in an azure blaze, collided with the darkness.<br><br>Boom!<br><br>Amidst the resounding echo that shook the underground prison, a voice rang out.<br><br>"Only family and disciples can enter a hospital room, you fucking bastard."<br><br>\* \* \*<br><br>Step by step.<br><br>I advanced through the settling dust.<br><br>Neither the ceaseless shower of debris from above nor the engulfing shadow hindered my progress.<br><br>I remained fixated on the figure awaiting me.<br><br>'Such a monster, but after all I didn't expect him to die so easily from that throw.'<br><br>Though unseen, I sensed the potent aura encasing the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>But I was not as afraid as before.<br><br>Silently, I clenched my fist, feeling a surge of power coursing through me.<br><br>'Heavenly Force Demon.'<br><br>The clash between me and the Western Heavenly Demon Lord presented a new opportunity for him.<br><br>The collapsing ceiling broke his shackles, and the old Demon Head was able to leave the prison for the first time in decades.<br><br>And the first words the Heavenly Force Demon said to me were completely unexpected.<br><br>'All the other prisoners have been killed.'<br><br>'Cough. So?'<br><br>'Why did you spare me?'<br><br>'Does that bother you?'<br><br>'Just answer the question. I could end your life right this moment.'<br><br>'Just wait a moment longer. It'll end on its own.'<br><br>'Bastard!'<br><br>It was a conversation between cripples.<br><br>One with crushed limbs, the other with severed meridians.<br><br>Yet, the Heavenly Force Demon held an edge over me — his Qi was not exhausted.<br><br>My life was ebbing away, the shadow of demise looming over me.<br><br>I yearned for one final dialogue with the observer of my fading existence.<br><br>'I didn't want to kill you.'<br><br>'Why not?'<br><br>'Because, the you I know wasn't a Demon Head.'<br><br>'......!'<br><br>'I think it's better to be a 'good guy' from the Demonic Cult than a 'bad guy' from the orthodox factions. Killing someone like you would make me feel like I was no different from a Demon Head.'<br><br>In fact, I hesitated a lot. Killing the Heavenly Force Demon could have given me a huge amount of experience points and several levels up.<br><br>After much contemplation, I abstained.<br><br>Looking back, it was probably for the best. The Western Heavenly Demon Lord wasn't someone I could defeat with just a level or two increase.<br><br>To meet death as a free soul rather than with resentment was a more palatable end.<br><br>'Well... this isn't too bad.'<br><br>The Heavenly Force Demon observed me with a complex expression before extending an offer.<br><br>'An offer I couldn't refuse.'<br><br>I recalled the Heavenly Force Demon's last words as I waved my hand.<br><br>The sudden gust of wind dispersed the dust clouds, revealing his figure.<br><br>"Your big brother has arrived." \[Note: the raw uses the word "hyung" but "big brother" seems more fitting in this particular sentence.\]<br><br>"Ha! Hahaha!"<br><br>Laughter erupted from the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, his figure shaking with mirth.<br><br>The vanished door to the treatment chamber revealed another person, wavering on their feet.<br><br>The Divine Doctor. His pale face nodded, indicating that Jeok Cheon-Gang was safe.<br><br>'Thank god. I'm not too late.'<br><br>A deep exhale escaped me as the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, his laughter subsided, raised his gaze.<br><br>"You have changed so much that it is difficult to recognize you."<br><br>"I received a gift. From someone I never expected."<br><br>"A gift?"<br><br>"Yes. I received energy."<br><br>An exclamation escaped the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.<br><br>"Transference of Power between Bodies!" \[Note: direct translation Energy Transmission between Bodies.\]<br><br>"Well, that's one way to call it."<br><br>"Did you use that technique you talked about? Similar to the Great Qi Absorption Method?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"You stumbled upon something great at the most opportune moment, haha!"<br><br>"I didn't stumble upon anything. I was asked for a favor."<br><br>"A favor?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>I affirmed softly, my mind echoing the Heavenly Force Demon's last words as he imparted his strength to me.<br><br>'The Western Heavenly Demon Lord...'<br><br>"He asked me to kill you."<br><br>Thud, thud, thud. Grasp.<br><br>I reached out my hand. White Flames, deeply embedded in the wall, shot forth into my hand.<br><br>The Fire Dragon, charged with the might of three gapja, unfurled its wings.<br><br>"You're... dead."<br><br>A broad grin spread across the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's face.</p>
