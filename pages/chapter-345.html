                        <p>Even though Murim is a place rampant with murder and violence, there's a rule that once you reach the upper echelons of any faction, you're expected to maintain a certain decorum and receive that same decorum in return.<br><br>'Especially if you're the head of a house within the Five Great Families, like the Tang Family of Sichuan.'<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok, for instance, was known for his forthrightness, but was unaccustomed to receiving it in kind.<br><br>Like now.<br><br>"Please lend us the Ring of All Poisons."<br><br>"......!"<br><br>A completely unexpected request.<br><br>As his eyelid twitched momentarily, Tang Sa-Dok retorted.<br><br>"Do you believe in such nonsensical stories? I knew you were young, but to be this naive..."<br><br>"I just saw your eyelid twitch."<br><br>"Nonsense!"<br><br>"Your voice gets louder because you're flustered, right?"<br><br>"Didn't I say no!"<br><br>"Oh, clenching your fist now?"<br><br>"It doesn't exist!"<br><br>"If I rummage through your pockets and find it, may I keep it?"<br><br>"Go ahead! Search! If you don't find it, I'll take your neck instead!"<br><br>"Ah, so you've hidden it somewhere else. Then, I will cancel."<br><br>"This...!" \[Note: the character used here is 이익 and is most probably the start of another word or sentence from Tang Sa-Dok, but can also be directly translated on its own as "Profit".\]<br><br>"Loss...!"<br><br>"How dare this damned brat!"<br><br>Ah, I should have held back on the last part.<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok's eyes rolled back in his head after being hit by a fantastic combo.<br><br>Before he could resort to concealed weapons, I interjected hastily.<br><br>"Just once! Just lend it to me once!"<br><br>"Didn't I say it doesn't exist!"<br><br>"Let's assume it doesn't. Just listen to what I have to say."<br><br>"Whatever you say, it won't change anything."<br><br>"Even if I tell you that I will kill the beast for you?"<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"I will kill the monster that harmed the Poison King, Grandmaster Tang Sa-Mun."<br><br>A beat passed.<br><br>"This bloody bastard dares to provoke me...!"<br><br>Swoosh.<br><br>Energy, green and shimmering like a desert mirage, cascaded over Tang Sa-Dok. His blazing eyes fixed on me as he spoke with measured calm,<br><br>"Do you really wish to die?"<br><br>"I have a bright future ahead of me, so no."<br><br>"Punishing that bastard is the responsibility of our family. Yet, you, an outsider, dare to take it from us!"<br><br>Whooosh!<br><br>A powerful gust of energy burst forth, rattling the chamber. Shielding the quaking Divine Doctor and Mun-Kyung, I countered,<br><br>"Have you had any success?"<br><br>"......!"<br><br>"The beast is a master strong enough to defeat the Poison King. Moreover, they caused a bloodbath in the Emei Sect, right under the Tang Family of Sichuan's watch, indicating that their strength isn't just in martial arts."<br><br>No matter how vast the lands of Sichuan are, it's where the Tang Family has been rooted for ages.<br><br>It's like letting the family's sworn enemy escape from the front yard. Tang Sa-Dok's face hardened as he had to return empty-handed despite leading most of the family on the chase.<br><br>"Are you blaming our family's incompetence now?"<br><br>"Of course not."<br><br>If the Tang Family of Sichuan were incompetent, then most of the martial sects scattered across the world should be barred and shut down.<br><br>The Nine Great Sects and the Five Great Families are the pillars of Murim. The issue at hand is the monstrous nature of the beast, not a shortfall on the part of the Tangs or the Emei Sect.<br><br>"I'm talking about probabilities."<br><br>"Probabilities?"<br><br>"The beast has martial arts comparable to the Ten Kings and is skilled in evasion. Wouldn't the likelihood of capturing them increase with more helping hands?"<br><br>"Our family's Green Shadow Squad are already pursuing them. I have returned temporarily to prepare for any emergencies, but it won't be long before we surely annihilate the creature."<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok's gaze pierced me and Cheong Pung.<br><br>"Our family is the great Tang Family of Sichuan. We do not need the help of outsiders, especially not from novice scum like you."<br><br>"......Sure."<br><br>I thought I had already far surpassed the level of a novice.<br><br>'And surely that guy has.'<br><br>Casting a side glance at Cheong Pung's dumbstruck expression, I idly scratched my head.<br><br>"Hmm, I figured it might go something like this."<br><br>Given the Tang Family of Sichuan's penchant for autonomy, their reaction was somewhat predictable.<br><br>That's why, while en route to the Tang estate, I devised a more enticing strategy.<br><br>"Then instead of help from novice scum, what about help from the Fire King?"<br><br>"......!"<br><br>"Let's say we manage to track down the monster. It's not going to willingly offer its arm for a quick injection of poison needles, will it?"<br><br>Those who wish to live versus those who wish to kill. A fierce battle is inevitable.<br><br>Deploying their full might, the Tangs could seek vengeance for the Poison King but at the cost of significant bloodshed.<br><br>Be they from the branches or the main family, numerous Tang descendants would fall.<br><br>"Grandfather, no, Master and I will help you. We'll minimize the Tang Family of Sichuan's losses and leave the monster's disposal to you, Patriarch."<br><br>"......Impossible. No matter the cost, our family must resolve this with our own power."<br><br>"Your response was a bit delayed."<br><br>"This is the path our ancestors have walked, the path that made the Tang Family of Sichuan what it is!"<br><br>"I am aware of the path the Tang Family of Sichuan has walked."<br><br>The family's bond is tight, a vendetta once sworn is pursued relentlessly, and justice is executed without mercy.<br><br>This resilience has earned the Tangs both reverence and fear.<br><br>I softly added,<br><br>"But sometimes, taking a shortcut doesn't necessarily mean people will point fingers. Especially if the reason for choosing that shortcut is to reduce the sacrifices of one's family members."<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok clenched his jaw.<br><br>Perhaps he isn't as cold-hearted as he appears.<br><br>Even if he was as cold-hearted as he appeared, he wouldn't be a ruthless Partriarch who prioritized revenge over their family.<br><br>'Otherwise, he wouldn't have returned to the family.'<br><br>But Tang Sa-Dok did come back, likely to defend the family from potential threats and protect those who would be vulnerable in his absence.<br><br>"What will you do?"<br><br>After a lengthy silence, he finally responded.<br><br>"......If - hypothetically - the Ring of All Poisons exists, could it heal Grandmaster Jeok?"<br><br>"According to someone I know, it could."<br><br>Prompted by my look, the Divine Doctor spoke up.<br><br>"We're almost ready. With the addition of the Ring of All Poisons, there shouldn't be any issue with the treatment."<br><br>"How long will it take?"<br><br>"Fifteen days. Fifteen days should be sufficient."<br><br>"Fifteen days..."<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok regarded the Divine Doctor, lowering his tone.<br><br>"I also examined Grandmaster Jeok's condition. Although my knowledge of poison far exceeds my medical skills, I couldn't determine the nature of his illness. Do you really think it's possible?"<br><br>"It is possible."<br><br>A confident affirmation cut through the room.<br><br>Mun-Kyung advanced, asserting,<br><br>"If it's the Divine Doctor, it's possible."<br><br>"A foolish boy. Is he your disciple?"<br><br>The Divine Doctor responded with a faint smile.<br><br>"The patient's revival necessitates the Ring of All Poisons. I understand the desire to conceal such a treasure, but I implore you to offer your help with benevolence and righteousness."<br><br>"Benevolence and righteousness, huh? Do you think the same?"<br><br>"Me?"<br><br>"Speak. I wish to hear your thoughts."<br><br>"If you insist."<br><br>I offered a nonchalant shrug,<br><br>"Rather than benevolence and righteousness, let's call it a matter of gratitudes and grudges."<br><br>"Why is that?"<br><br>"Because it's the Murim. If someone offers help, it's only right to repay them, according to the laws of our society."<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok's weathered face briefly softened with amusement.<br><br>"That sounds much better."<br><br>"It's not just lip service."<br><br>"What if, while Grandmaster Jeok is being treated, the monster escapes far away?"<br><br>"I'll chase them down and capture them myself. Ah, but not right away, of course. I won't move an inch until my Master awakens."<br><br>"You're a funny man. Even if the monster is someone that you would enjoying tearing to shreds, they are a formidable Master. And you, a mere novice, think you can capture such a being?"<br><br>"If I cannot capture it, then I will kill it."<br><br>"Ha, haha!"<br><br>His laughter erupted, then ceased abruptly.<br><br>"The Ring of All Poisons does not exist."<br><br>"......Excuse me?"<br><br>No way, what is this bullshit?<br><br>Has this old man been playing me this whole time?<br><br>Just as I was feeling a dull ache in the back of my head, Tang Sa-Dok continued speaking.<br><br>"The Ring of All Poisons is nothing but an old legend. Even among our family, it's considered an ancient tale."<br><br>"What, it doesn't exist? Really?"<br><br>"Nobody knows, and nobody should know."<br><br>"Fuck. Then you should have said that from the beginning! Now you're just fucking with me......"<br><br>Ssss.<br><br>I silenced myself, taken aback.<br><br>From Tang Sa-Dok's garments, a white serpent emerged, its gaze piercing mine.<br><br>'What's this now?'<br><br>Not Voldemort for sure, but why is there suddenly a snake here?<br><br>And it even has horns, unlike any snake I've ever seen. As I glared back into the black eyes of the snake, the Divine Doctor murmured,<br><br>"The Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent...?"<br><br>Merely the name evoked dread.<br><br>Tang Sa-Dok, noticing my retreat, laughed softly, caressing the serpent's distinctive head.<br><br>"There's no need to be afraid. It's not a dangerous creature."<br><br>"The name sounds pretty dangerous, though."<br><br>"The Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent?"<br><br>"Yes. What kind of name is that? It's not a friendly Golden Retriever... Anyway, does the Ring of All Poisons really not exist?"<br><br>"It's not the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent; it's Mimi."<br><br>"Excuse me?"<br><br>"Tang Mimi. That's the name I gave it."<br><br>A chill ran down my spine...<br><br>As Tang Sa-Dok tenderly patted Mimi, his gaze shifted to the Divine Doctor.<br><br>"You would know. This creature is not an ordinary Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent."<br><br>The Divine Doctor nodded.<br><br>"The Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent is known to be a highly toxic and rare creature, entirely black and with a fierce nature. It is impossible to tame. But..."<br><br>"As you can see. This one not only looks different, but its temperament is also very gentle."<br><br>"But who knows when it might turn. A single drop of its venom could kill a hundred cows, couldn't it?"<br><br>"No need to worry. This one has no poison."<br><br>"Excuse me?"<br><br>"To be precise... it has lost its poison."<br><br>After finishing his sentence, Tang Sa-Dok locked eyes with Mimi-chan, no, the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent.<br><br>It was but a brief moment, but there was clearly a connection, and the intelligent snake understood its master's intent.<br><br>Shush, shush!<br><br>Lowering its head and emitting a soft, metallic hiss, the serpent delicately ejected an object into Tang Sa-Dok's outstretched hand.<br><br>With a gentle thud, an item, coated in a viscous sheen, came into view.<br><br>'That is...'<br><br>A ring.<br><br>The ring, crowned with a dark gem that seemed to swallow the light around it, pulsated with a sinister yet captivating glow.<br><br>Having neutralized the potent venom of the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent, it radiated a foreboding beauty.<br><br>"Could it be?"<br><br>My voice was a whisper, disbelief mingling with awe, as I fixed my gaze on the ring, entranced. Tang Sa-Dok, with a tone of quiet assurance, broke the spell.<br><br>"Remember. Nobody knows, and nobody should know."<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>"Then take it."<br><br>He offered the ring, his gesture laden with gravity.<br><br>"It is my family's most sacred treasure."<br><br>As my hands, unsteady with anticipation, accepted the ring, a chime resounded.<br><br>Ding.<br><br>\- Quest Condition, \[Acquisition of the Ring of All Poisons\] completed!<br><br>\- Linked Quest, \[Ring of All Poisons\] successfully completed!</p>
