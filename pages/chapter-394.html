Please, just call me Michael.」</p><p>"Ah, yes."</p><p>Does everyone in that area bear the Johnson surname? As if they're all part of some great Johnson Family of L.A..</p><p>I exchanged handshakes with Michael, my confusion apparent.</p><p>His grin widened post-handshake.</p><p>"Why are you smiling?"</p><p>「I'm a big fan of yours, Shibaljwa.」</p><p>"…I’d really appreciate it if you called me Jin instead of Emperor Fuck."</p><p>「Why? I think that nickname sounds pretty cool.」</p><p>"Should I call you Little Johnson then?"</p><p>Michael replied with a serious expression.</p><p>「No.」</p><p>His resolve left me momentarily speechless, and I countered,</p><p>"It’s a similar context. So, please just call me Jin."</p><p>「Ah, okay.」</p><p>That damned nickname appears to be gaining international notoriety.</p><p>Cheon Tae-Min, who defeated the Demon King and is called the savior of the 21st century, earned the cool title of 'Slayer,' but even if I beat a Demon God instead of a Demon King, it seems I'll still remain Emperor Fuck. \[Note: foreshadowing?\]</p><p>Should this escalate, I might well become the God of Fucks.</p><p>"Don't feel too bad. Emperor Fuck has a nice ring and warmth to it, doesn’t it?"</p><p>"Mr. Choi, are you making fun of me now?"</p><p>"Why would I?"</p><p>Michael gave Mr. Choi a knowing look and chuckled.</p><p>「Mr. Choi. You've come as well.」</p><p>"Do you know me?"</p><p>「Of course. Rumors have already spread mong the guild members about how much Johnson likes you.」</p><p>"......"</p><p>I elbowed Mr. Choi in the ribs as his face turned pale.</p><p>"Don't feel too bad. Johnson's Johnson likes you, after all."</p><p>"......Jin Tae-Kyung. You just mentioned 'Johnson' twice."</p><p>"Did I? Must have slipped out."</p><p>Ignoring Mr. Choi's piercing look, I turned to Michael.</p><p>"Where is Johnson?"</p><p>「Ah, I'll guide you there.」</p><p>As we entered the lobby, the buzzing stopped, and all eyes were on us.</p><p>I had heard that a few civilians were rescued overnight, but it seemed the temporary command center was only occupied by soldiers.</p><p>「The atmosphere changes as soon as Jin appears, doesn't it?」</p><p>"I was already famous, but I became even more so after yesterday."</p><p>「Oh, did you happen to catch a Named Monster?」</p><p>At Michael's inquiry, I just shrugged.</p><p>"Well, something like that."</p><p>Given General Liao's standing in the military, he definitely qualifies as 'Named.'</p><p>Despite the supposed gag order, I could tell from the soldiers' hushed whispers that the rumors were circulating.</p><p>「Did you hear? Yesterday, Mr. Jin did something to the General...」</p><p>「I heard about that, but wasn't it just a rumor?」</p><p>「It's not a rumor, it's true. Hunters and even the headquarters operational soldiers said so. Liao Yang heard it clearly.」</p><p>「Huh, that's disappointing if it's true.」</p><p>「Me too. I thought he was a hero of the people.」</p><p>It was the reaction I had anticipated.</p><p>As the saying goes, 'the shrimp backs the crab, and the arm bends inward.' Naturally, my actions of striking my direct superior did not sit well with other soldiers... \[Note: the Korean proverb "the shrimp backs the crab, and the arm bends inward" suggests that people naturally support those close to them, similar to how an arm bends towards oneself, implying favoritism or loyalty towards one's own group or interests.\]</p><p>「He shouldn't just be breaking limbs; he should have torn off his head.」</p><p>「Exactly. Because of that pig, how many have died?」</p><p>「He grabbed a big piece of the pie in the recent military industry corruption scandal, didn't he? That's why they quietly overlook even if his limbs are broken. After all, following Mr. Jin lets them pick up crumbs of merit to cover themselves.」</p><p>「He's a damn thief. Such a man should be hanged in Tiananmen Square.」</p><p>...Their disdain for him is apparent.</p><p>Whispers spread among the ordinary soldiers and the officers alike.</p><p>They label him an incompetent fool who sacrificed his own troops. Now they realize why they're still using water bottles from the era of the civil war between the Nationalists and Communists.</p><p>In light of these revelations and General Liao's notorious reputation, numerous comments could lead to charges of insubordination.</p><p>"The atmosphere is good, isn't it? If it stays this way, there won't be any worries later."</p><p>Mr. Choi, walking beside me, remarked, prompting me to react with a wry smile.</p><p>"Indeed. Had I known, I would have hit him a few more times."</p><p>"Hmm. There are still a few high-grade potions left."</p><p>"Mr. Choi, you’re quite good at joking now."</p><p>"Well, it's not entirely a joke."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>His sudden seriousness caught me off guard.</p><p>Staring intently, Mr. Choi responded.</p><p>"Mr. Jin Tae-Kyung, you are undeniably an S-rank hunter. A symbol and dream of the common people, a celebrity who has captured the public's support. On the other hand, General Liao represents corrupt privilege itself. To mess with Mr. Jin Tae-Kyung, one would have to be prepared for a significant burden."</p><p>"So, it wouldn’t matter if I hit him more?"</p><p>"There would be repercussions, but you won't be held back by a soon-to-fall character like General Liao."</p><p>"Really, just a few hours ago, you were telling me not to cause trouble?"</p><p>"Even the best sports car can crash if you only step on the accelerator. There has to be someone like me to apply the brakes, right? And..."</p><p>Mr. Choi continued softly.</p><p>"Sometimes, the track must be maintained to let the sports car run well. Like now."</p><p>"...?"</p><p>"Yesterday, too many people witnessed the situation. If the gag order can't be maintained, it might be better to spread it quickly."</p><p>It didn't take long for my confusion to turn into understanding.</p><p>"Mr. Choi, by any chance?"</p><p>Mr. Choi looked at me with my mouth agape and smiled.</p><p>"Spreading favorable rumors quickly by taking the initiative. It’s a method often used by Vice Guild Leader Lee Jeong-Ryong."</p><p>"…Ah."</p><p>Everything suddenly clicked.</p><p>I was puzzled by how swiftly the rumors had spread, making the gag order appear futile, and it was evident Mr. Choi had planned this in advance.</p><p>The Public Security Force hunters harbored a deep resentment toward General Liao, which made them easy to influence, and the soldiers...</p><p>'They were paid.'</p><p>Ultimately, that was the essence of it. Mr. Choi had secured their silence with money, directing the rumors to unfold most advantageously for us.</p><p>Aren't military bases rife with countless microphones and speakers?</p><p>'Rumors spread fast.'</p><p>If ten people talk, a hundred will listen, and each of those hundred will tell a thousand more. During this chain, liberally seasoned with enticing exaggerations, the bloated rumors rapidly solidify into perceived truth.</p><p>'And to think he managed this overnight.'</p><p>I regarded Mr. Choi with a look of deep respect.</p><p>"Mr. Choi, are you Zhuge Liang? Or perhaps Zhang Liang?" \[Note: Zhuge Liang was a renowned military strategist during the Three Kingdoms period in China, celebrated for wisdom, inventive strategies, and loyal service. Zhang Liang was one of the chief advisors to Liu Bang, the founder of the Han Dynasty, as is known for his strategic acumen and his crucial role in Liu Bang's rise to power.\]</p><p>"This is no big deal."</p><p>"Mr. Rice. That's so like you." \[Note: I'm not exactly sure what the rice is in reference to in this context. My best guess is that given how rice is such a cultural staple (it's not often where you eat something that is not accompanied by rice), by calling Mr. Choi "Mr. Rice" the MC is implying that Mr. Choi is indispensable and dependable.\]</p><p>"......Please stop."</p><p>While we conversed, Michael halted in front of a door.</p><p>Knock knock.</p><p>「Mr. Johnson. It's Michael.」</p><p>Behind the door labeled 'VIP Private Room,' the atmosphere shifted as a deep yet jovial voice called out.</p><p>「Oh, come on in.」</p><p>「That's my cue to leave.」</p><p>Michael shrugged at us and stepped aside.</p><p>Noticing Mr. Choi's anxious expression, I smoothly pushed the door handle to the side.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>The door swung open, revealing two figures.</p><p>「Ha ha, nice to see you again, charming young folks!」</p><p>A towering black man, Magic Johnson, came forward with his large hand outstretched.</p><p>And then...</p><p>"Eek!"</p><p>A corpulent pig startled at my presence.</p><p>Watching General Liao's trembling cheeks, I grasped Magic Johnson's hand and murmured.</p><p>"When did you arrive?"</p><p>「About thirty minutes ago?」</p><p>"What about the front line you're overseeing, and why didn't you come find us immediately instead of staying with that person?"</p><p>「Wait a moment. I'll answer in order, but first, let me say hello to Mr. Choi.」</p><p>Snatch.</p><p>Like a hawk seizing its prey, Magic Johnson exuberantly grasped Mr. Choi's hand.</p><p>「Have you been well? Have you thought of me?」</p><p>"......Yes."</p><p>Mr. Choi's response was undoubtedly sincere. He must have had a multitude of thoughts on his way here.</p><p>Yet, his words inadvertently pleased Magic Johnson, who was oblivious to their deeper significance.</p><p>「Oh, that's the same for me. We do have a lot in common, don't we?」</p><p>"......"</p><p>It appears, though, that you differ significantly in certain preferences.</p><p>「Anyway, I'm glad to see you again.」</p><p>After a final, meaningful glance at Mr. Choi, Magic Johnson returned to the initial query.</p><p>「And Jin, if you're talking about the southern front I'm in charge of, there's no need to worry. A brief absence won't cause problems.」</p><p>"It seems the situation on the front is quite favorable."</p><p>「Hmm. Well, it's encouraging that the monster legions are retreating on all fronts.」</p><p>"Aha, the monster legions are retreating... what?"</p><p>Mr. Choi and I exchanged surprised glances.</p><p>What could this possibly mean?</p><p>Regaining his composure faster than I, Mr. Choi questioned Magic Johnson.</p><p>"This is the first we're hearing of this. Mr. Johnson, could you explain what's happening?"</p><p>「It's exactly as I said. Last night, the monster legions pulled back. It seems the same thing happened on all fronts.」</p><p>"But we haven't detected any such movements on our side."</p><p>「Ah, I should correct that. This western front is the exception.」</p><p>"How so?"</p><p>「What? Hahaha!」</p><p>Magic Johnson laughed heartily and clapped me on the shoulder as he explained.</p><p>「Of course, because this place, the western front, is the deepest into enemy territory. I don't know what tricks the Archlich is trying to pull, but the western front is like a highway that's already been breached. They've retreated as much as they can already.」</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>I had briefly forgotten. Unlike other fronts that progressed cautiously under the combined defense of the army and air force, engaging in structured combat, I had surged ahead, wreaking havoc and decimating all in my path.</p><p>'I had broken through with unstoppable momentum, but was it to this extent?'</p><p>Amused by my reaction, Magic Johnson chuckled deeply.</p><p>「You don't quite look like the Genghis Khan of the 21st century. You've achieved tremendous feats. Why not smile a bit?」</p><p>"It's still too early to relax and smile. But aside from the monster legions retreating from the front, what brings you here?"</p><p>「I came to see Mr. Choi.」</p><p>"......!"</p><p>"......!"</p><p>「Just kidding.」</p><p>Look at Mr. Choi's pale face. One more joke, and he'll rupture his sphincter.</p><p>「It seems I need to temporarily pull some personnel out, so I had to deliver orders to the General.」</p><p>"You're pulling them out? Where to?"</p><p>「Chengdu. A military conference has been convened.」<br></p>
