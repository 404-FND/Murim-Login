## 📖 Background

After reaching the end of the Murim Login manhwa and being completely captivated by the story, I found myself craving more. The natural next step was to dive into the light novel to continue the journey. However, this led to an unexpected challenge.

## 🤔 The Problem

The official Murim Login translations left much to be desired, making it difficult to fully enjoy the rich world and characters. Meanwhile, high-quality fan translations exist but are scattered across Reddit and various forums, creating a fragmented and frustrating reading experience.

## 💡 The Solution

This project creates a simple, clean, and ad-free website that consolidates all the fan-translated chapters of Murim Login in one place. No distractions, no tracking, no monetization—just a seamless reading experience for fellow fans.
